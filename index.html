Welcome to the research site of the
<a href="https://immunedynamics.io/team">Immune Dynamics team</a>, 
a multi-disciplinary collaboration between the 
<a href="https://sydneycytometry.org.au/">Sydney Cytometry Facility</a>
and multiple 
<a href="https://immunedynamics.io/team">research and technology labs at the</a>
<a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/">University of Sydney</a>,
combining expertise in immunology, infectious disease, high-dimensional single-cell & imaging technologies, computational biology, and data science. 
Collectively, our work involves the development of various high-dimensional 
<a href="https://immunedynamics.io/research/tech/">cytometry & imaging methods</a> 
with the 
<a href="https://sydneycytometry.org.au/">Sydney Cytometry Facility</a>, 
as well as the creation of
<a https://immunedynamics.io/research/analysis/>advanced computational analysis</a> approaches, 
to address challenges in modern single-cell and imaging sciences. 
We then apply these technologies and approaches collaboratively to the study of immunology and infectious disease, including emerging pathogens such as 
<a href="https://immunedynamics.io/research/disease/">SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19</a>, 
<a href="https://immunedynamics.io/research/disease/">Zika virus encephalitis</a>, and 
<a href="https://immunedynamics.io/research/disease/">West Nile virus encephalitis</a>.
Our members include Dr. Thomas Ashhurst, Dr. Mark Read. Dr. Felix Marsh-Wakefield, Givanna Putri, Prof. Nicholas King, ... etc.
