Welcome to the research site of
<a href="https://immunedynamics.io/thomas-ashhurst">Dr. Thomas Ashhurst</a>
(<a href="https://sydneycytometry.org.au/">Sydney Cytometry Core Research Facility</a>, <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/">The University of Sydney</a>)
and the 
<a href="https://immunedynamics.io/team">Immune Dynamics team</a>, a multi-disciplinary collaboration of multiple research labs, combining expertise in immunology, infectious disease, high-dimensional single-cell & imaging technologies, computational biology, and data science. 
Our research involves the development of various high-dimensional cytometry & imaging assays, as well as advanced computational analysis approaches, to address challenges in modern single-cell and imaging sciences, in close collaboration with the Sydney Cytometry Facility. 
We then apply these technologies and approaches collaboratively to the study of immunology and infectious disease, including emerging pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, Zika virus encephalitis, and West Nile virus encephalitis.
