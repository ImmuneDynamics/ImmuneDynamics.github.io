Welcome to the research site of 
<a href="https://immunedynamics.io/thomas-ashhurst">Dr. Thomas Ashhurst</a>
(
<a href="https://sydneycytometry.org.au/">Sydney Cytometry Facility</a>
, The University of Sydney)
and the 
<a href="https://immunedynamics.io/team">Immune Dynamics team</a>
, a multi-disciplinary collaboration of multiple research and technology labs, combining expertise in immunology, infectious disease, high-dimensional single-cell & imaging technologies, computational biology, and data science. 
Collectively, our work involves the development of various high-dimensional cytometry & imaging assays with the 
<a href="https://sydneycytometry.org.au/">Sydney Cytometry Facility</a>
, as well as advanced computational analysis approaches, to address challenges in modern single-cell and imaging sciences. 
We then apply these technologies and approaches collaboratively in the study of immunology and infectious disease, including emerging pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, Zika virus encephalitis, and West Nile virus encephalitis.
