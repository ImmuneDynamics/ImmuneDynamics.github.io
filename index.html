Welcome to the Immune Dynamics home page. We are a multidisciplinary collaboration of <a href="https://immunedynamics.github.io/team/">ultiple laboratories</a> interested in developing open-source analysis solutions for high-dimensional cytometry and spatial data. Funded originally through the <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/infectious-diseases-institute/">Sydney Institute for Infectious Diseases</a>, our underlying goal is to better understand the pathogenesis of infectious and inflammatory diseases. However, these methods are generalisable to the study of any immune or cellular system.

Find out more about our approaches on our <a href="https://immunedynamics.github.io/research">research</a> page, or check out our analysis tools on our <a href="https://immunedynamics.github.io/resources">resource</a> or <a href="https://immunedynamics.github.io/spectre">SPECTRE</a> pages.
