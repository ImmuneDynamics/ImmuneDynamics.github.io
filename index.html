Welcome to the research site of
<a href="https://immunedynamics.io/thomas-ashhurst">Dr. Thomas Ashhurst</a>
(<a href="https://sydneycytometry.org.au/">Sydney Cytometry Core Research Facility</a>, <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/">The University of Sydney</a>)
and the 
<a href="https://immunedynamics.io/team">Immune Dynamics team</a>, a multi-disciplinary collaboration of multiple research labs, combining expertise in immunology, infectious disease, high-dimensional single-cell & imaging technologies, computational biology, and data science. 
This team draws from the 
<a href="https://sydneycytometry.org.au/">Sydney Cytometry Core Research Facility]</a>, the 
<a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/schools/school-of-medical-sciences/discipline-of-pathology.html">Discipline of Pathology</a>, the 
<a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/our-research/school-of-medical-sciences.html">Discipline of Infectious Disease and Immunology</a>, and the 
<a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-computer-science.html">School of Computer Science]</a>, at the 
<a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/">University of Sydney]</a>. 
Collectiely, our work involves the development and application of a range of high-dimensional single-cell cytometry/imaging assays, as well as computational analysis approaches, to map dynamic immune responses over time, space, and disease in a range of disease setting.
