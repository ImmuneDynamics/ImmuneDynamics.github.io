Welcome to the research site of the
<a href="https://immunedynamics.io/team">Immune Dynamics team</a>, 
a multi-disciplinary collaboration between the 
<a href="https://sydneycytometry.org.au/">Sydney Cytometry Core Research Facility</a>
and multiple 
<a href="https://immunedynamics.io/team">research and technology labs</a>
at the
<a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/">University of Sydney</a>
and the
<a href="https://www.centenary.org.au/">Centenary Institute</a>,
established as a result of a seed funding grant from the
<a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/marie-bashir-institute/">Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity</a>. 
This group combines expertise in immunology, infectious disease, high-dimensional single-cell & imaging technologies, computational biology, and data science, drawing from the
<a href ="https://sydneycytometry.org.au/">Sydney Cytometry Core Research Facility</a>, 
the 
<a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/schools/school-of-medical-sciences.html">School of Medical Sciences</a>, 
and the 
<a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-computer-science.html">School of Computer Science</a> at the 
<a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/)">University of Sydney</a>.
Collectively, our work involves the development of high-dimensional 
<a href="https://immunedynamics.io/research/">cytometry & imaging methods</a> 
with the 
<a href="https://sydneycytometry.org.au/">Sydney Cytometry Core Research Facility</a>, 
as well as the creation of
<a href="https://immunedynamics.io/research">advanced analysis approaches</a>, 
to address challenges in modern single-cell and imaging sciences. 
We apply these technologies and approaches collaboratively to the study of immunology and infectious disease, including emerging pathogens such as 
<a href="https://immunedynamics.io/research/">SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19</a>, 
<a href="https://immunedynamics.io/research/">Zika virus encephalitis</a>, and 
<a href="https://immunedynamics.io/research/">West Nile virus encephalitis</a>.
This team is led by 
<a href= "https://immunedynamics.github.io/thomas-ashhurst/">Dr. Thomas Ashhurst</a>
and
<a href="https://marknormanread.github.io/">Dr. Mark Read</a>, 
with
<a href="https://immunedynamics.github.io/felix-marsh-wakefield/">Dr. Felix Marsh-Wakefield</a>, 
<a href="https://immunedynamics.github.io/givanna-putri/">Givanna Putri</a>, 
<a href="https://immunedynamics.github.io/team/">Prof. Nicholas King</a>, 
... etc.
