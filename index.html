Welcome to the research site of Dr. Thomas Ashhurst (Sydney Cytometry Core Research Facility, The University of Sydney) and the Immune Dynamics team, 
a multi-disciplinary collaboration of multiple research and technology labs, combining expertise in immunology, infectious disease, high-dimensional single-cell & imaging technologies, computational biology, and data science. 
Collectively, our work involves the development of various high-dimensional cytometry & imaging assays with the Sydney Cytometry Facility, as well as advanced computational analysis approaches, to address challenges in modern single-cell and imaging sciences. 
We then apply these technologies and approaches collaboratively in the study of immunology and infectious disease, including emerging pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, Zika virus encephalitis, and West Nile virus encephalitis.
