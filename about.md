[**Dr. Thomas Ashhurst**](https://immunedynamics.io/thomas-ashhurst/) is an immunologist and high-dimensional cytometry specialist with the [Sydney Cytometry Core Research Facility](https://sydneycytometry.org.au) at [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). In this role he provides advanced training and consultation for users of high-dimensional cytometry platforms, and leads a research effort to develop and apply a range of [single-cell cytometry/imaging technologies and assays](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#high-dimensional-cytometry-and-imaging-technologies), as well as [computational analysis tools](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#computational-analysis-approaches), to map dynamic immune responses over time, space, and disease. In particular, he applies these technologies and approaches collaboratively to the study of immunology and infectious disease, including emerging pathogens such as [SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease), [Zika virus encephalitis](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease), and [West Nile virus encephalitis](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease).

Our team works closely with collaborating labs, and the [Sydney Cytometry Facility](https://sydneycytometry.org.au/), to develop and apply various high-dimensional cytometry and imaging assays, as well as advanced computational analysis approaches, to map dynamic immune responses over time and space in a range of disease settings, including [viral encephalitis](https://immunedynamics.io/research) and [COVID-19](https://immunedynamics.io/research). 

One of our key initiatives has been the development of [Spectre](https://immunedynamics.io/spectre/), an R package and computational toolkit that enables comprehensive end-to-end integration, exploration, and analysis of high-dimensional cytometry data from different batches or experiments ([Ashhurst TM, Marsh-Wakefield F, Putri GH et al., 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.22.349563v1.abstract)). You can read more about our development and application work on the [research](https://immunedynamics.io/research) page, or about our community and education activities on the [community](https://immunedynamics.io/community) page.
