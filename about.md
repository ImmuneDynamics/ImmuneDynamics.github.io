Dr. Thomas Ashhurst is an immunologist and high-dimensional cytometry specialist with the [Sydney Cytometry Core Research Facility](https://sydneycytometry.org.au) at [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). In this role he provides advanced training and consultation for users of high-dimensional cytometry platforms, and leads a research effort to develop and apply a range of [single-cell cytometry/imaging technologies and assays](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#high-dimensional-cytometry-and-imaging-technologies), as well as [computational analysis tools](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#computational-analysis-approaches), to map dynamic immune responses over time, space, and disease. In particular, he applies these approaches collaboratively to the study of immunology and infectious disease, including emerging pathogens such as [SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease), [Zika virus encephalitis](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease), and [West Nile virus encephalitis](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease).

## Immune Dynamics Team

The ‘[Immune Dynamics](https://immunedynamics.io/team)’ team is a multi-disciplinary collaboration of multiple research labs, led by [Dr. Thomas Ashhurst](https://immunedynamics.github.io/thomas-ashhurst/) ([Sydney Cytometry Facility](https://sydneycytometry.org.au), USYD) and [Dr. Mark Read](https://immunedynamics.github.io/mark-read/) ([School of Computer Science](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-computer-science.html), USYD). This group combines expertise in immunology, infectious disease, high-dimensional single-cell & imaging technologies, computational biology, and data science, drawing from the [Sydney Cytometry Core Research Facility](https://sydneycytometry.org.au/), the [Discipline of Pathology](https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/schools/school-of-medical-sciences/discipline-of-pathology.html), the [Discipline of Infectious Disease and Immunology](https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/our-research/school-of-medical-sciences.html), and the [School of Computer Science](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-computer-science.html), at the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). Our team works closely with collaborating labs, and the [Sydney Cytometry Facility](https://sydneycytometry.org.au/), to develop and apply various high-dimensional cytometry and imaging assays, as well as advanced computational analysis approaches, to map dynamic immune responses over time and space in a range of disease settings, including [viral encephalitis](https://immunedynamics.io/research) and [COVID-19](https://immunedynamics.io/research).
