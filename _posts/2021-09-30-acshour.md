**Upcoming workshops**

A summary of our upcoming workshops can be found at [https://immunedynamics.io/workshops](https://immunedynamics.io/workshops).

1. [ASI IgV Masterclass on Quantitative Immunology](https://www.immunology.org.au/events/2021-IgV-Masterclass-on-Quantitative-Immunology/) (**online, Mon 25-Oct to Tue 26-Oct 2021**): in addition to [talks](https://www.immunology.org.au/events/2021-IgV-Masterclass-on-Quantitative-Immunology/) on single-cell analysis, imaging, and COVID-19/respiratory immunology (Mon 25-Oct), we will be offering a [hands on workshop](https://immunedynamics.io/workshops/masterclass2021) (Tue 26-Oct) applying high-dimensional analysis techniques to profile the immune response to COVID-19 in the blood and respiratory tract.
2. [ACS Annual Meeting](https://cytometryconference.org.au/) (**online, Sun 7-Nov to Wed 10-Nov**): as part of the annual conference we will be offering a number of workshops on high-dimensional analysis approaches, including the optimisation of clustering and dimensionality reduction, as well as methods for [batch correction](https://wiki.centenary.org.au/x/zGCdCw) and [data integration](https://wiki.centenary.org.au/x/zGCdCw).
