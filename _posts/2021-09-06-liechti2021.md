We are delighted to share our commentary on "[cytometry in the high-dimensional era](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-021-01006-z)", out now in with [Nature Immunology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-021-01006-z). There are a number of common challenges in creating and analysing high-dimensional cytometry data, including issues relating to spreading error, data transformaton, summary statistics, heatmap visualisations, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and batch effects/alignment. Here we discuss these challenges and provide guidelines and best practices for how best to tackle these issues.

This paper is a product of a wonderful collaboration with [Thomas Liechti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAACH1ZvkBulHXcDL_3JWUOtb08NqI5h_W_vQ?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BF5ioVbM7T8CzogA7HeNQ%2BQ%3D%3D), [Lukas Weber](https://twitter.com/lmwebr), [Natalie Stanley](https://twitter.com/natstann), [Martin Prlic](https://twitter.com/PrlicLab), [Sofie Van Gassen](https://twitter.com/SofieVanGassen), and [Florian Mair](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-mair-fm/).
