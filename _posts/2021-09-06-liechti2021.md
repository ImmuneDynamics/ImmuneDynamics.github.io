High-dimensional cytometry experiments measuring 20â€“50 cellular markers have become routine in many laboratories. The increased complexity of these datasets requires added rigor during the experimental planning and the subsequent manual and computational data analysis to avoid artefacts and misinterpretation of results. Here we discuss pitfalls frequently encountered during high-dimensional cytometry data analysis and aim to provide a basic framework and recommendations for reporting and analyzing these datasets.
