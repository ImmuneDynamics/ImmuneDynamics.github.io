#### High-dimensional analysis 'homeshow': #### 

To continue our commitment to promote cytometry education during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have transformed our popular annual ACS Roadshow to a virtual Homeshow! The topic will be on the most voted “High Dimensional Data Analysis Strategies”.

The Homeshow will be held across 5 days with a 60 minute interactive lecture in the morning with plenty of time for Q&A and a 90 minute Hand-on workshop in the afternoon (in two streams). The highly qualified HiDi gurus will share their experiences in many hot topics of HiDi data analysis and present the strategic approaches of HiDi data analysis.

When will ACS Homeshow be held?
