## Webinar Summary

In conventional fluorescence cytometry, each fluorophore in a panel is measured in a target detector, through the use of wide band-pass optical filters. 
In contrast, spectral cytometry uses a large number of detectors with narrow band-pass filters to measure a fluorophore's signal across the spectrum, creating a more detailed fluorescent signature for each fluorophore. 
The spectral approach shows promise in adding flexibility to panel design and improving the measurement of fluorescent signal. 
However, few comparisons between conventional and spectral systems have been reported to date. Here we present our findings comparing conventional and spectral approaches to cytometry—including comparisons of compensation and unmixing—and evaluate the use of spectral cytometry for immune profiling in viral diseases.
