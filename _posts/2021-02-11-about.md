Immunologist and high-dimensional cytometry specialist with the [Sydney Cytometry Facility](https://sydneycytometry.org.au) at the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). In this role, I develop and apply a range of [single-cell cytometry technologies](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/) and [computational analysis tools](https://github.com/ImmuneDynamics/Spectre) to map dynamic immune responses over time, space, and disease. In particular, I apply these approaches to the study of immunology and infectious disease, including emerging pathogens such as [SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(21)00019-7), [Zika virus encephalitis](https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12974-019-1566-5), and [West Nile virus encephalitis](https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-2094-9-246).

My training includes a Bachelor of Science from the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/) where I majored in Immunolobiology and Virology, with honours in Cell Pathology (2011). Subsequently I completed a Ph.D. in Medicine (Pathology) with [Prof. Nicholas King](https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/nicholas-king.html) at the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/), studing the mobilisation of the murine haematopoietic & immune systems in response to West Nile and Zika virus encephalitis using high-dimensional flow and mass cytometry (2019). In 2014, I recieved my training in [mass cytometry](https://sydneycytometry.org.au/masscytometry/cytof) in the laboratory of [Dr. Garry Nolan](http://web.stanford.edu/group/nolan/) at [Stanford Univeristy](https://www.stanford.edu/) as a visiting researcher.

I am an [ISAC Marylou Ingram Scholar](https://isac-net.org/page/ThomasAshhurstBio) with the International Society for the Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC) and serve as the 'Systems Cytometry' & NSW representative of the [Systems Immunology](https://www.immunology.org.au/asi-programs-and-opportunities/special-interest-groups/systems-immunology/) special interest group of the [Australian and New Zealand Society of Immunology](https://www.immunology.org.au/). I am also actively involved in the [Australasian Cytometry Society](https://cytometry.org.au/), [Oz Single Cell consortium](https://www.singlecells.org.au/), and [Human Cell Atlas](https://www.humancellatlas.org/) community.
