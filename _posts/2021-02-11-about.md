The Immune Dynamics Team develop and apply high-dimensional cytometry and imaging assays, as well as computational analysis tools, to map dynamic immune responses over time, space, and disease. These approaches are applied to the study of immunology and infectious disease, including emerging pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, Zika virus encephalitis, and West Nile virus encephalitis.
