Spectre is an R package that enables comprehensive end-to-end integration and analysis of high-dimensional cytometry data from different batches or experiments. Spectre streamlines the analytical stages of raw data pre-processing, batch alignment, data integration, clustering, dimensionality reduction, visualisation and population labelling, as well as quantitative and statistical analysis. To manage large cytometry datasets, Spectre was built on the [data.table](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/) framework â€“ this simple table-like structure allows for fast and easy processing of large datasets in R. Critically, the design of Spectre allows for a simple, clear, and modular design of analysis workflows, that can be utilised by data and laboratory scientists.
