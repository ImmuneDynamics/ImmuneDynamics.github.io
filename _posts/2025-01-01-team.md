The ‘[Immune Dynamics team](https://immunedynamics.io/team)’ is a multi-disciplinary team, combining expertise in immunology, high-dimensional single-cell technologies, computational biology, and data science; drawing from the [Sydney Cytometry Core Research Facility](https://sydneycytometry.org.au/), the [Discipline of Pathology](https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/schools/school-of-medical-sciences/discipline-of-pathology.html), and the [School of Computer Science](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-computer-science.html), at the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). Our team focuses on the development of novel computational analysis approaches to address challenges in modern single-cell sciences, and the collaborative application of these approaches in the study of immunology and infectious diseases, including [COVID-19](https://immunedynamics.io/research). 

You can read more about our development and application work on the [research](https://immunedynamics.io/research) page, or about our community and education activities on the [community](https://immunedynamics.io/community) page.

[**Dr. Thomas Ashhurst**](https://immunedynamics.github.io/thomas-ashhurst/) is an immunologist and high-dimensional cytometry specialist with the [Sydney Cytometry Core Research Facility](https://sydneycytometry.org.au) at [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). In this role he provides advanced training and consultation for users of high-dimensional cytometry platforms, and leads a research effort to develop and apply a range of [single-cell cytometry/imaging technologies and assays](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#high-dimensional-cytometry-and-imaging-technologies), as well as [computational analysis tools](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#computational-analysis-approaches), to map dynamic immune responses over time, space, and disease. In particular, he applies these approaches collaboratively to the study of immunology and infectious disease, including emerging pathogens such as [SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease), [Zika virus encephalitis](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease), and [West Nile virus encephalitis](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease).

[**Dr. Felix Marsh-Wakefield**](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6PaVkisAAAAJ&hl=en) is a post-doctoral researcher part of the Liver Injury & Cancer (Centenary Institute) and Human Cancer & Viral Immunology Laboratory (University of Sydney). He is an immunologist interested in investigating the role of various immune cells in a range of diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma and multiple sclerosis. This primarily involves bioinformatics to assist in the analysis of high dimensional data, including that of imaging mass cytometry. He is part of the Marylou Ingram Scholarship Program run by the International Society for the Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC).
