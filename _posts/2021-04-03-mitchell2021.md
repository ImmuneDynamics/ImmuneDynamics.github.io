**Abstract**

High-dimensional  cytometry  represents  an  exciting  new  era  of  immunology  research, enabling  the  discovery  of  new  cells  and  prediction  of  patient  responses  to  therapy.  A plethora of analysis and visualisation tools and programmes are now available for both new  and  experienced  users;  however,  the  transition  from  low-dimensional  to  high-dimensional  cytometry  requires  a  change  in  the  way  users  think  about  experimental design  and  data  analysis.  Data  from  high-dimensional  cytometry  experiments  are  often under-utilised, due to both the size of the data and the number of possible combinations of markers, as well as to a lack of understanding of the processes required to generate meaningful  data.  In  this  article,  we  explain  the  concepts  behind  designing  high-dimensional cytometry experiments and provide considerations for new and experienced users  to  design  and  carry  out  high-dimensional  experiments  to  maximise  quality  data collection
