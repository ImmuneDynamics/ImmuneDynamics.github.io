Following a seed funding grant from the [Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity](https://www.sydney.edu.au/marie-bashir-institute/), we established the ‘[Immune Dynamics](https://github.com/ImmuneDynamics)’ team, a collaborative group combining expertise in immunology, high-dimensional single-cell technologies, computational biology, and data science; drawing from the [Sydney Cytometry Core Research Facility](https://sydneycytometry.org.au/), the [Discipline of Pathology](https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/schools/school-of-medical-sciences/discipline-of-pathology.html), and the [School of Computer Science](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-computer-science.html), at the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). Our team focuses on the development of novel computational analysis tools to address challenges in modern single-cell sciences, and the application of these tools in the study of immunology and infectious diseases, such as [COVID-19](https://immunedynamics.io/research).

We have developed a number of computational analysis approaches, including [Spectre](immunedynamics.io/spectre), an R package that enables comprehensive end-to-end integration and analysis of high-dimensional cytometry data from different batches or experiments ([Ashhurst\*,  Marsh-Wakefield\*, Putri\* et al. bioRxiv. 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.22.349563v1.abstract)). To facilitate the analysis of time-series data, we have also developed a number of time-series clustering algorithms, including [ChronoClust](https://github.com/ghar1821/Chronoclust) ([Putri et al. 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705119300796)) and [TrackSOM](https://github.com/ghar1821/TrackSOM), which we recently applied to the study of [COVID-19](https://immunedynamics.io/research) ([Koutsakos et al. 2021](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(21)00019-7)). Most recently, we have adapted the Spectre package to facilitate spatial analysis of IMC data ([SpectreMAP Github](https://github.com/ImmuneDynamics/SpectreMAP)). 

Our ongoing work is focused on the development of better data integration approaches and spatial analysis tools. You can read more about our work on the [research](https://immunedynamics.io/research) page.

[**Dr. Thomas Ashhurst**](https://immunedynamics.github.io/thomas-ashhurst/) is an immunologist and high-dimensional cytometry specialist with the [Sydney Cytometry Core Research Facility](https://sydneycytometry.org.au) at [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). In this role he provides advanced training and consultation for users of high-dimensional cytometry platforms, and leads a research effort to develop and apply a range of [single-cell cytometry/imaging technologies and assays](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#high-dimensional-cytometry-and-imaging-technologies), as well as [computational analysis tools](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#computational-analysis-approaches), to map dynamic immune responses over time, space, and disease. In particular, he applies these approaches collaboratively to the study of immunology and infectious disease, including emerging pathogens such as [SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease), [Zika virus encephalitis](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease), and [West Nile virus encephalitis](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease).

[**Dr. Felix Marsh-Wakefield**](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6PaVkisAAAAJ&hl=en) is a post-doctoral researcher part of the Liver Injury & Cancer (Centenary Institute) and Human Cancer & Viral Immunology Laboratory (University of Sydney). He is an immunologist interested in investigating the role of various immune cells in a range of diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma and multiple sclerosis. This primarily involves bioinformatics to assist in the analysis of high dimensional data, including that of imaging mass cytometry. He is part of the Marylou Ingram Scholarship Program run by the International Society for the Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC).
