Following a seed funding grant from the [Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity](https://www.sydney.edu.au/marie-bashir-institute/) (*"Mapping dynamic immunity: next-generation computational approaches to track the evolution of immune responses in West Nile virus and Zika virus encephalitis"*), we established the ‘[Immune Dynamics](https://github.com/ImmuneDynamics)’ team, a collaborative group with a focus on the development of novel computational analysis tools to address these challenges. 

Our team and I have developed a number of computational analysis approaches, including [SPECTRE](https://wiki.centenary.org.au/display/SPECTRE), an R package that enables comprehensive end-to-end integration and analysis of high-dimensional cytometry data from different batches or experiments ([Ashhurst\*,  Marsh-Wakefield\*, Putri\* et al. bioRxiv. 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.22.349563v1.abstract)). To facilitate the analysis of time-series data, we have also developed a number of time-series clustering algorithms, including [ChronoClust](https://github.com/ghar1821/Chronoclust) ([Putri et al. 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705119300796)) and [TrackSOM](https://github.com/ghar1821/TrackSOM), which we recently applied to the study of [COVID-19](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease) ([Koutsakos et al. 2021](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(21)00019-7)). We have also developed novel multi-perspective methods for the evaluation of clustering algorithms ([Putri et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab038)). Most recently, we have adapted the Spectre package to facilitate spatial analysis of IMC data ([SpectreMAP Github](https://github.com/ImmuneDynamics/SpectreMAP)). Our ongoing work is focused on the development of better data integration approaches and spatial analysis tools.
