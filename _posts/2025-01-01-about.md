[**Dr. Thomas Ashhurst**](thomas-ashhurst/) is an immunologist and high-dimensional cytometry specialist with the [Sydney Cytometry Core Research Facility](https://sydneycytometry.org.au) at [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). In this role he provides advanced training and consultation for users of high-dimensional cytometry platforms, and leads a research effort to develop and apply a range of [single-cell cytometry/imaging technologies and assays](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#high-dimensional-cytometry-and-imaging-technologies), as well as [computational analysis tools](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#computational-analysis-approaches), to map dynamic immune responses over time, space, and disease. In particular, he applies these approaches collaboratively to the study of immunology and infectious disease, including emerging pathogens such as [SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease), [Zika virus encephalitis](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease), and [West Nile virus encephalitis](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease).
