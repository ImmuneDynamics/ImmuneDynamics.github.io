**COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS**: here we provide resources to facilitate computational analysis of high-dimensional cytometry data, including [Spectre](https://wiki.centenary.org.au/display/SPECTRE), an R package that enables comprehensive end-to-end integration and analysis of high-dimensional cytometry data from different batches or experiments.

**Spectre R package**: 

- Pre-print: [Ashhurst\*,  Marsh-Wakefield\*, Putri\* et al. bioRxiv. 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.22.349563v1.abstract).
- Protocols and instructions: [website](https://immunedynamics.github.io/spectre).
- Presentation on Spectre at Oz Single Cell 2020, 'Computational Biology': [Youtube](https://youtu.be/poEDERGXrQw?t=3151).

**Webinars and tutorials**:

- Talk on clustering and dimensionality reduction at the ACS 'homeshow': [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/embed/MSIDmYhqe5g).
- Clustering and dimensionality reduction approaches in FlowJo: [Tutorial](https://wiki.centenary.org.au/x/mYGoBw)
