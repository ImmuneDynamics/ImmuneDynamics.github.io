**Collecting serum**

- Collect blood (multiple options), and transfer into a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube or similar
- Allow to sit at room temperature for 30 min
- If unable to process immediately, keep on ice
- SPIN: 1000 xg, 10 min, room temperature
- Collect serum (top fluid layer) and transfer to 2-3 0.5 mL eppendorf tubes (2-3 aliquots per sample)
- Freeze at -20*C to -80*C

<br />

**Collecting plasma**

- Collect blood in a syringe with 50 uL of 0.5 M EDTA. This is sufficient to collect 500 uL of blood (i.e. a final EDTA concentration of 0.05 M)
- Transfer into a 1.5 mL eppendorf tube or similar
- If unable to process immediately, keep on ice
- SPIN: 1000 xg, 10 min, room temperature
- Collect serum (top fluid layer) and transfer to 2-3 0.5 mL eppendorf tubes (2-3 aliquots per sample)
- Freeze at -20*C to -80*C

<br /> 

**Thawing**

- Thaw tubes
- SPIN: 1000 xg, 10 min, room temperature (to remove particulates)
- Pipette the fluid layer (leaving any particulates at the bottom) and transfer to a new tube
- Avoid multiple (> 2) freeze/thaw cycles
