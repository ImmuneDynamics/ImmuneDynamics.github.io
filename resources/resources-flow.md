**FLOW & SPECTRAL CYTOMETRY**: Below is a collection of resources and protocols for flow cytometry and spectral cytometry.

**Published protocols**:
- High-dimensional panel design: [Paper](https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpim.37). *Also see [this paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpim.26/abstract) for basic panel design.*
- Flow cytometry staining protocol for mouse bone marrow: [Paper](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-9454-0_12).
- Voltage optimisation: [Paper](https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpim.37).
- The impact of adjusting PMT voltages on spillover, compensation, and spreading error: [Webinar](https://sydneycytometry.org.au/seminars-and-tutorials), [paper](https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpim.37).
- Spectral vs conventional cytometry: [Paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cyto.a.24211).
