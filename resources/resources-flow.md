In flow cytometry, a suspension of single cells is labelled with antibodies against various surface or intracelluar targets. These antibodies are conjugated to fluorescent molecules (fluorophores) which, when excited by a laser, emit light that is captured by a fluorescence detector. The use of multiple lasers and detectors allow us to label cells with up to 26 individual fluorophore conjugated antibodies using our existing assays.

**Spectral vs conventional cytometry**:

- For a comparison of spectral and conventional flow cytometry, see our [paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cyto.a.24211) ([Niewold\*, Ashhurst\* et al. 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cyto.a.24211)).  

**Panel design**:
