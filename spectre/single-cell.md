title: Spectre - Single-Cell Integration and Analysis
permalink: /spectre/single-cell/
---

In [Spectre v2](https://immunedynamics.io/spectre/), we are significantly expanding functionality for the analysis of data generated by any form of single-cell sequencing, cytometry, and imaging/spatial technologies. To facilitate this, we have constructed a Spectre [object](https://immunedynamics.io/spectre/object) which prioritises simplicity, but incorporates a low level of organisation to facilitate the management of any type of single-cell or spatial data. Critically, we are incorporating new workflows that not only allow us to investigate datasets from multiple technologies in a single analysis, but also to integrate these datasets to either perform a joint analysis, or to leverage 'reference' datasets such as those generated by the [Human Cell Atlas](https://www.humancellatlas.org/), via cell classification and label transfer onto query datasets.
