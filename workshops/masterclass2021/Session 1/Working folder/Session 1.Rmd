# Hands on practical 3

For this mini session, we will install packages from CRAN, Bioconductor, and GitHub.

Firstly, we will install the *data.table* package from CRAN by running the following code:
```{r install data.table, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
install.packages("data.table", repos="https://cran.csiro.au/")
```

For bioconductor, you need to install BiocManager first from CRAN:
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
install.packages("BiocManager", repos="https://cran.csiro.au/")
```
Then use the install function from *BiocManager* to install the desired package. 
We will install FlowSOM package to be used in later session for clustering.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
BiocManager::install("FlowSOM")
```

To install packages from Github, you need to first install the *remotes* package:
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes", repos="https://cran.csiro.au/")
```
For this example, we will install the *Spectre* package which will be used in subsequent sessions for analysing COVID-19 samples.
To do this, you need to first locate the github repository where the package is stored.
For Spectre, it is: <https://github.com/ImmuneDynamics/Spectre>
Note, the repository you need to supply is whatever comes after github.com.
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("immunedynamics/Spectre")
```

# Hands on practical 4

For this mini session, we will perform some basic data manipulation using R and Spectre package.

## 1. Setting working directory
What is a working directory? A default location in your computer your R script will be working from, e.g. loading data or exporting data.
Use the following *setwd* function to set your working directory:
```{r}
setwd("/Users/givanna/Documents/")
```

If you want to create a directory within your current working directory, use *dir.create* function:
```{r warning=FALSE}
dir.create("ASI_workshop_session1")
```

We will set our working directory to the new directory we just created:
```{r}
setwd("ASI_workshop_session1/")
```

Your working directory now should be in the following directory: */Users/givanna/Documents/ASI_workshop_session1*.
To check, run the following function:
```{r}
getwd()
```


> #### TIP
> If you press ctrl + space, you can get Rstudio to autocomplete a path or a function.

## 2. Loading Spectre package
This step assumes you have successfully installed Spectre package. If not, please refer to the previous hands-on mini session.
Run the following *library* function to load Spectre package.
```{r}
library(Spectre)
```


## 3. Read in some data
Here, we will try to read in a demo dataset stored in CSV files.
You can download the dataset from Spectre's GitHub repository: <https://github.com/ImmuneDynamics/Spectre/tree/master/workflows/Classic%20workflows/data>.

Download all the files, and save them in your working directory.

The following function is handy to see what files we have in the current working directory:
```{r}
list.files()
```


Now, we will use the *read.files* function in Spectre to read in the FCS file and store it in *dat* variable.
```{r}
dat <- read.files(file.loc = getwd(), file.type = ".csv")
```

>#### TIP
> To read fcs file, change the file.type to .fcs

The function *read.files* will read each file in the *file.loc* directory as a data.table and store them in a list
```{r}
class(dat)
```
```{r}
names(dat)
```

Our samples are split into 12 files. The *read.files* function read in each file and store them in a list.
We can merge all of them into 1 big data.table for ease of processing using *do.merge.files* function:
```{r}
dat <- do.merge.files(dat)
```


Check what is the type of variable dat:
```{r}
class(dat)
```
It should say data.frame and data.table which is essentially a table like structure.

## 4. Investigate the data
Let's look at the content of the data.
First, let's show the first 10 rows in the data:
```{r}
head(dat, n = 10)
```
***NOTE:*** The *n* parameter denotes the number of rows to show.

>#### TIP
> You can also see the entire data content by clicking the "table" icon in the environment tab on top right panel.

A handy function to see what markers/columns we have in the data:
```{r}
names(dat)
```
We have a fair few markers as well as a column denoting the files each cell come from (FileName and FileNo).
Let's say we want don't want to see the FileName and FileNo column in our dataset. 
How do we do that?
First we store the column names we want to keep in a vector called *markers_cols*:
```{r}
markers_cols <- names(dat)[1:9]
markers_cols
```

Then we simply subset the data and store it in another variable:
```{r}
dat_marker_only <- dat[, ..markers_cols]
```

Let's inspect it:
```{r}
head(dat_marker_only)
```
Let's pretend we have forgotten how many samples/files we had previously and want to retrieve it back:
```{r}
samples <- dat$FileName
```
The above command will show you the sample each file come from, but we're only interested in what samples we have, so we use the *unique* function to see all the distinct samples we have:
```{r}
unique(samples)
```


Say we're instered in knowing the mean of CD3 and NK11 expression
```{r}
cd3_mean <- mean(dat$CD3)
nk11_mean <- mean(dat$NK11)
```

```{r}
cd3_mean
```

```{r}
nk11_mean
```

>#### TIP
> You can refer to the environment panel to see their values! 

Say we want to sum them up and store them:
```{r}
cd3_plus_nk11 <- cd3_mean + nk11_mean
cd3_plus_nk11
```


Say you want to add the expression of Ly6G and CD11b for each cell and append the value as a new column.
First, we store it in a variable:
```{r}
ly6g_plus_cd11b <- dat$Ly6G + dat$CD11b
```

Then append it as a column
```{r}
dat$ly6g_plus_cd11b <- ly6g_plus_cd11b
```


Let's inspect just the ly6G, cd11b and the new sum column
```{r}
head(dat[, c("Ly6G", "CD11b", "ly6g_plus_cd11b")])
```

Say we want to isolate cells with Ly6G > 0 and B220 > 0
```{r}
dat_subset <- dat[dat$Ly6G > 0 & dat$B220 > 0,]
head(dat_subset)
```

The new subset won't have any cells with negative Ly6G or B220
```{r}
min(dat_subset$Ly6G)
```

```{r}
min(dat$Ly6G)
```

```{r}
min(dat_subset$B220)
```

```{r}
min(dat$B220)
```


## 5. Save the subsetted data as CSV or FCS file.
We will use Spectre's write.files function.

>#### TIP
> If you forget what the write.files function looks like, you can ask Rstudio!
> Or if you don't even remember what the function name is, look it up using the "Packages" tab at the bottom right panel.

```{r}
?write.files
```


***NOTE:*** This function relies on the flowCore package to write out FCS file. 
If you don't have it installed, we can install it using Bioconductor then load it.
```{r}
BiocManager::install("flowCore")
library("flowCore")
```

Then run the *write.files* function:
```{r}
write.files(dat = dat_subset,
            file.prefix = "demo_data_subset",
            write.csv = TRUE,
            write.fcs = TRUE)

```
