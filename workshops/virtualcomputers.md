For your workshop, we have prepared virtual computers that you can connect to and use to perform the analysis we demonstrate during the session. The relevant software has been pre-installed, so you can get started immediately with the analysis process. **You will receive an email with specific instructions for how to register for one of the computers**, and then you can follow the instructions below to access and interact with the virtual computers.

If you have an issues with the steps below, please email [thomas.ashhurst@sydney.edu.au](mailto:thomas.ashhurst@sydney.edu.au). 

<br />



## 1. Register for a computer using the link you were emailed

---

***If you are on Mac, download Microsoft [Remote Desktop app](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12) from the app store.***

You will receive an email inviting you to register and connect to one of the computers -- go to that link and enter your details. Note: If you do not have a Microsoft account, you will be prompted to create one. Click “get a new Microsoft account”.

Wait until the system finalise the registration process

Once done, you will see a page similar to the following, but will have the name of your workshop. The word “Stopped” indicate the computer is not turned on yet.

The computer template itself might not be launched yet, in which case you will see the following -- not to worry, this just means we are finalising some of the software and datasets that will come pre-installed on the computer! We will let you know when the computers are online.
