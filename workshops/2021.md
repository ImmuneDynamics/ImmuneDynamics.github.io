# High-dimensional analysis homeshow (online) - 2021

![Analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomashhurst/tomashhurst.github.io/master/images/Clusters%20wide.png)

We are pleased to announce we will be running the **High-Dimensional Analysis Homeshow** again in 2021, building on the success of the [ACS homeshow in 2020](https://immunedynamics.io/homeshow/). Run in partnership with the [Systems Immunology]() special interest group (SIG) of the [Australia and New Zealand Society for Immunology](), the [Australasian Cytometry Society](), and the [Oz Single Cell]() consortium, we will be providing daily lectures and hands-on workshops over the course of a week ([Monday 12-July]() to [Friday 16-July 2021]()), covering various aspects of high-dimensional analysis of cytometry and single-cell data. 

*Blurb about comp analysis, COVID, etc -- approaches, best practices, validation, relevance with the atlas projects, etc*



<br />


## Details

**Dates**: [Monday 12-July]() to [Friday 16-July 2021]()

**Times**: Presentations each morning ([1000 - 1130 AEST]()) and workshops each afternoon ([1400 - 1600 AEST]())

**Daily topics**:

- Monday: overview of high-dimensional cytometry and single cell technologies and analysis
- Tuesday: computational analysis of flow, spectral, or mass cytometry data using clustering (e.g. FlowSOM) and dimensionality reduction  (e.g. tSNE)
- Wednesday: managing batch effects and computational methods of batch alignment
- Thursday: performing meaningful differential, quantitative, and statistical analysis
- Friday: advanced topics (image analysis, pseudotime, time-series, integrating data from multiple technologies, etc)

**Where**: Online (live)

**Recordings**: Recordings of the lectures, as well as the material covered in the workshops will be made available online (free of charge) at the completion of the week.
