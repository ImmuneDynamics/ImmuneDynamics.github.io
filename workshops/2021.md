# High-dimensional analysis homeshow (online) - 2021

![Analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomashhurst/tomashhurst.github.io/master/images/Clusters%20wide.png)

We are pleased to announce we will be running the **High-Dimensional Analysis Homeshow** again in 2021, building on the success of the [ACS homeshow in 2020](https://immunedynamics.io/homeshow/). Run in partnership with the [Systems Immunology]() special interest group (SIG) of the [Australia and New Zealand Society for Immunology](), the [Australasian Cytometry Society](), and the [Oz Single Cell]() consortium, we will be providing daily lectures and hands-on workshops over the course of a week ([Monday 12-July]() to [Friday 16-July 2021]()), covering various aspects of high-dimensional analysis of cytometry and single-cell data. 

*Blurb about comp analysis, COVID, etc -- approaches, best practices, validation, relevance with the atlas projects, etc*
