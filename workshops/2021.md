# High-Dimensional Analysis Homeshow (online) - 2021

![Analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomashhurst/tomashhurst.github.io/master/images/Clusters%20wide.png)

The recent expansion of high-dimensional flow, spectral, and mass cytometry (CyTOF) has lead to a significant shift in our approach to analysing immunological data. As the size and complexity of high-dimensional cytometry data continue to expand, computational analysis approaches are essential. New computational methods (such clustering, dimensionality reduction, and batch alignment) allow for comprehensive exploration of high-dimensional cytometry datasets, providing unique insights into cell biology and the immune response to disease. However, the application of these new methods can be inherently challenging.

To address these challenges, we are pleased to run the [High-Dimensional Analysis Homeshow](https://immunedynamics.io/homeshow/) again in 2021, organised in partnership with the [Systems Immunology]() special interest group (SIG) of the [Australia and New Zealand Society for Immunology](), the [Australasian Cytometry Society](), and the [Oz Single Cell]() consortium. We will be providing daily presentations (1.5 hrs) and hands-on workshops (2 hrs) over three days, covering various aspects of high-dimensional cytometry analysis, including data preparation, clustering, dimensionality reduction, batch alignment, statistical analysis, and validation. The homeshow is suitable for both beginners and those more experienced in high-dimensional analysis, and two workshop streams will be offered to accomodate these levels of experience.
