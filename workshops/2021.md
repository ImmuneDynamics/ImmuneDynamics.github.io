# High-Dimensional Analysis Homeshow (online) - 2021

![Analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomashhurst/tomashhurst.github.io/master/images/Clusters%20wide.png)

New computational methods of data analysis allow for comprehensive exploration of high-dimensional cytometry datasets, allowing for unique insights into cell biology and the immune response to disease. However, the use of these new methods can be inherently challenging. To address these challenges, we are pleased to announce we will be running the [High-Dimensional Analysis Homeshow](https://immunedynamics.io/homeshow/) again in 2021, run in partnership with the [Systems Immunology]() special interest group (SIG) of the [Australia and New Zealand Society for Immunology](), the [Australasian Cytometry Society](), and the [Oz Single Cell]() consortium. We will be providing daily lectures (1.5 hrs) and hands-on workshops (2 hrs) between [Monday 17-July]() and [Wednesday 19-July 2021](), covering various aspects of high-dimensional analysis of cytometry and single-cell data. The homeshow is suitable for both beginners, and those more experienced in high-dimensional analysis.
