As part of the Australia and New Zealand Society for Immunology (ASI) IgV Masterclass (25-26 October 2021), we will be running an online hands-on workshop on high-dimensional analysis approaches to investigate the immune response to COVID-19 in the blood and respiratory tract. Registrations will be open to both ASI members and non-members. Keep an eye on the ASI IgV Masterclass page for more information.

In this session, we will work through a tutorial designed to introduce users to the concepts of high-dimensional analysis for cytometry data, including clustering (e.g. FlowSOM) and dimensionality reduction (e.g. tSNE, UMAP), as well as various plotting and statistical analysis functions.

In this session we will investigate immune response to COVID-19 in the blood, in patient samples from healthy controls, mild COVID-19, and severe COVID-19.
