As part of the Australia and New Zealand Society for Immunology (ASI) IgV Masterclass (25-26 October 2021), we will be running an online hands-on workshop on high-dimensional analysis approaches to investigate the immune response to COVID-19 in the blood and respiratory tract. Registrations will be open to both ASI members and non-members. Keep an eye on the ASI IgV Masterclass page for more information.

<h2>1. Introduction to high-dimensional cytometry analysis (0930 - 1100)</h2>

---

In this session, we will work through a tutorial designed to introduce users to the concepts of high-dimensional analysis for cytometry data, including clustering (e.g. FlowSOM) and dimensionality reduction (e.g. tSNE, UMAP), as well as various plotting and statistical analysis functions.

<br />
<br />

<h2>2. Analysis of blood-borne immune responses to COVID-19 (1130 - 1330)</h2>

---

In this session we will investigate immune response to COVID-19 in the blood, in patient samples from healthy controls, mild COVID-19, and severe COVID-19.

<br />
<br />

<h2>3. Analysis of respiratory immune responses to COVID-19 (1430 - 1600)</h2>

---

In this session we will investigate immune response to COVID-19 in the respiratory tract, analysing cells isolated from patients intubated with a endotracheal tube in treatment of severe COVID-19.
