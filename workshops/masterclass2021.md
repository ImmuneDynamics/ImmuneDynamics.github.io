As part of the Australia and New Zealand Society for Immunology (ASI) IgV Masterclass (25-26 October 2021), we will be running an online hands-on workshop on high-dimensional analysis approaches to investigate the immune response to COVID-19 in the blood and respiratory tract. Registrations will be open to both ASI members and non-members. Keep an eye on the ASI IgV Masterclass page for more information.
