**Introduction**: New [computational methods of analysis](https://wiki.centenary.org.au/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=166697248) (such clustering, dimensionality reduction, and batch alignment) allow for comprehensive exploration of high-dimensional cytometry datasets, providing unique insights into cell biology and the immune response to disease. However, the application of these new methods can be inherently challenging. To address these challenges, the [Immune Dynamics](https://immunedynamics.github.io/) team and [Sydney Cytometry Core Research Facility](https://sydneycytometry.org.au/) are pleased to run the [High-Dimensional Analysis Homeshow](https://immunedynamics.io/homeshow/) again in 2021,with support from the [Systems Immunology special interest group (SIG)]() of the [Australia and New Zealand Society for Immunology](), the [Australasian Cytometry Society](), and the [Oz Single Cell]() consortium. 

**Format**: Over three days we will be providing [daily presentations](https://immunedynamics.io/hd2021/#program) (1.5 hrs) and [hands-on workshops](https://immunedynamics.io/hd2021/#program) (2 hrs) on various aspects of high-dimensional analysis, including: data preparation, clustering, dimensionality reduction, batch alignment, statistical analysis, validation.

**Audience**: The homeshow is suitable for both beginners and those more experienced in high-dimensional analysis, and two workshop streams will be offered to accomodate these levels of experience. Key topics include: 

**Dates**: [Monday 17-July]() to [Wednesday 19-July]() 2021: daily [presentations](https://immunedynamics.io/hd2021/#program) (1000 - 1130 AEST) and [workshops](https://immunedynamics.io/hd2021/#program) (1400 - 1600 AEST).

**Location**: Online, with recordings to be made available.

**Cost**: 
- Lectures: free
- Workshops (viewing only): free
- Workshops (interactive attendance): $XX per person per workshop ($XX for students) (max 30 places in each days workshop)

**Registration**: **[REGISTER HERE]()**
