Critical to investigating complex immune responses to disease is the capacity to measure cells at the single-cell level, examining multiple features of the cell simultaneously. To address this, we have developed and applied a variety of high-dimensional cytometry, single-cell, and spatial methods, through the [Sydney Cytometry Core Research Facility](https://sydneycytometry.org.au/). These technologies include high-dimensional [flow cytometry](https://immunedynamics.io/resources/flow) (including the world's first 10-laser 30-parameter ‘LSR-X’ platform developed with BD ([Ashhurst et al. 2017](https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpim.37)), [spectral cytometry](https://immunedynamics.io/resources/flow), as well as Australia's first [mass cytometer](https://tomashhurst.github.io/resources/mass) (CyTOF) and [Imaging Mass Cytometer](https://tomashhurst.github.io/resources/imc) (IMC). Most recently this has expanded to including [single-cell transcriptomics and multi-omics](https://immunedynamics.io/resources/).
