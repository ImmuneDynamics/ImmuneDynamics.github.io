Critical to investigating complex immune responses to disease is the capacity to measure cells at the single-cell level, examining multiple features of the cell simultaneously. To address this, we develop and apply a variety of high-dimensional cytometry technologies and assays. 

<br />

## High-dimensional flow cytometry

We have developed novel technology platforms, such as our world first [10-laser ‘LSR-X’ platform](https://sydneycytometry.org.au/hdflow) developed with BD, and one of the first published 25 colour flow cytometry assays ([Ashhurst et al. 2017](https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpim.37)). 

<br />

## Spectral cytometry

Most recently, we have implemented high-dimensional spectral cytometry platforms and panels, and performed comprehensive evaluations of both conventional and spectral cytometry ([Niewold\*, Ashhurst\* et al. 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cyto.a.24211)). 

<br />

## Mass cytometry (CyTOF)

We also developed the first assays to be used on [Australia’s first mass cytometer (CyTOF)](https://www.immunology.org.au/files/Newsletter_pdfs/ASI_NL_March_2015.pdf) ([Ashhurst et al. 2019](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-9454-0_12)), as well as Australia’s first Imaging Mass Cytometer (IMC, [SpectreMAP Github](https://github.com/ImmuneDynamics/SpectreMAP)). We have recently published a book ([HM McGuire, TM Ashhurst (eds). 2019](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4939-9454-0)), featuring a collecting of up-to-date and cutting-edge protocols in mass cytometry, which is now a standard resource in the field.
