## Engagement in the Human Cell Atlas and other communities ##

We are actively involved in the [Human Cell Atlas (HCA)](https://www.humancellatlas.org/) community, including attendance at HCA general meetings in Hinxton, UK (2018), and [Tokyo, Japan (2019)](https://youtu.be/xYqd2w_aRH0?t=327), seeking to help define the contribution of high-dimensional cytometry and imaging technologies to the HCA objectives ([Czechowska et al. 2018, WS06: 'Cytometry in the Era of the Human Cell Atlas'](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cyto.a.23777)). We also presented on Spectre, one of our computational tools, at the [HCA Asia meeting](https://youtu.be/95dy_p5FFck?t=15491) (virtual) in 2020.

We have taken a key role in two roadshows hosted by the [Australasian Cytometry Society (ACS)](https://cytometry.org.au/): [Polychromatic Flow Cytometry](https://www.malaghan.org.nz/news/world-class-roadshow-for-flow-cytometry-community/) in 2016 (Dr. Pratip Chattopadhyay and Thomas Ashhurst), and [High-Dimensional Cytometry Analysis](https://www.immunology.org.au/files/Newsletter_pdfs/ASI017_Dec_2020.pdf#page=35) in 2020 (Dr. Thomas Ashhurst, Dr. Felix Marsh-Wakefield, and Givanna Putri).
