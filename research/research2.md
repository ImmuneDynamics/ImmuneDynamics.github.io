**Overview**: beginning in the laboratory of [Prof. Nicholas King]() (Pathology, USYD), and now continuing within the [Sydney Cytometry Facility]() (USYD) and the multi-disciplinary [Immune Dynamics](https://immunedynamics.io/team/) team, our work involves the development and application of a range of [high-dimensional single-cell cytometry/imaging technologies and assays](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#high-dimensional-cytometry-and-imaging-technologies), as well as [computational analysis approaches](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#computational-analysis-approaches), to map dynamic immune responses over time, space, and disease. We collaboratively apply these approaches to the study of immunology and infectious disease, including emerging pathogens such as [SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease), [Zika virus](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease) encephalitis, and [West Nile virus](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease) encephalitis. We then explore how these datasets, technologies, and analysis methdologies may contribute to, or benefit from, efforts such as the [Human Cell Atlas (HCA)](http://humancellatlas.org/).

## Development of high-dimensional cytometry and spatial technologies

![Tech](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomashhurst/tomashhurst.github.io/master/images/HDtech3.png)

Critical to investigating complex immune responses to disease is the capacity to measure cells at the single-cell level, examining multiple features of the cell simultaneously. To address this, we develop and apply a variety of high-dimensional cytometry technologies and assays. We have developed novel technology platforms, such as our world first 10-laser ‘LSR-X’ platform developed with BD, and one of the first published 25 colour flow cytometry assays (Ashhurst et al. 2017). We also developed the first assays to be used on Australia’s first mass cytometer (CyTOF) (Ashhurst et al. 2019), as well as Australia’s first Imaging Mass Cytometer (IMC, SpectreMAP Github). We have recently published a book (HM McGuire, TM Ashhurst (eds). 2019), featuring a collecting of up-to-date and cutting-edge protocols in mass cytometry, which is now a standard resource in the field. Most recently, we have implemented high-dimensional spectral cytometry platforms and panels, and performed comprehensive evaluations of both conventional and spectral cytometry (Niewold*, Ashhurst* et al. 2020).
