**Overview**: beginning in the laboratory of [Prof. Nicholas King]() (Pathology, USYD), and now continuing within the [Sydney Cytometry Facility]() (USYD) and the multi-disciplinary [Immune Dynamics](https://immunedynamics.io/team/) team, our work involves the development and application of a range of [high-dimensional single-cell cytometry/imaging technologies and assays](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#high-dimensional-cytometry-and-imaging-technologies), as well as [computational analysis approaches](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#computational-analysis-approaches), to map dynamic immune responses over time, space, and disease. We collaboratively apply these approaches to the study of immunology and infectious disease, including emerging pathogens such as [SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease), [Zika virus](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease) encephalitis, and [West Nile virus](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease) encephalitis. We then explore how these datasets, technologies, and analysis methdologies may contribute to, or benefit from, efforts such as the [Human Cell Atlas (HCA)](http://humancellatlas.org/).

Below = areas of research, development, and application. Can find the research interests of our individual members via the 'Team' page.

## Computational analysis and data integration across single-cell technologies
A major focus of our collaborative group is the development of computational analysis solutions for high-dimensional cytometry data.

- Important -- ability to test and compare different clustering, DR, and alignment/integration tools -- in Spectre, make it easy to run multiple tools to optimiset he approach 
- Inspire by efforts of HCA
- Sought to create an interface that would allow a seamless transition across a wide variety of single-cell data types -- including flow, spectral, CyTOF, and scRNAseq, including multiomic assays such as CITE-seq and Abseq
- In particular faciliate integration and label transfer between datasets, so that reference datasets generated by the HCA and other groups could be leveraged in a wide variety of contexts, in both HD cytometry and single-cell SEQ
- --> by creating a platform and data-agnostic platform, we can efficiently incorporate various analysis tools, and particular integration tools, developed for cytometry (e.g. FlowSOM) and transcriptomics (e.g. Harmony, Liger, Seurat)
- By doing this, multiple approaches can be efficiently run and compared

--> in our case, focusing on methods that can scale to large datasets consisting of millions of cells (ref https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1850-9#Abs1)

Development
- Spectre for computational analysis
- Batch alignment/integration
- Paretobench and DR dev
- ICB paper example

Application
— examples in WNV/ZIKV/COVID etc

## Time-series clustering analysis for mapping dynamic immune responses
- Another major focus is the incorporation of time-series analysis approaches, as this is an under-developed field, but critical in many areas on biology

Development
- ChronoClust
- TrackSOM

Application
— examples in COVID etc

## Spatial analysis of high-dimensional imaging data

- Spatial analysis platform --> integrated with Spectre
- Improved cell segmentation workflows
- Spatial statistics and neighbourhood analysis
— examples in TBC

## Community contributions and activitiers

- Roadshow examples
- Workshops
- HCA...

## *TBC: Development of high-dimensional cytometry and spatial technologies*

Critical to investigating complex immune responses to disease is the capacity to measure cells at the single-cell level, examining multiple features of the cell simultaneously. To address this, we develop and apply a variety of high-dimensional cytometry technologies and assays. We have developed novel technology platforms, such as our world first 10-laser ‘LSR-X’ platform developed with BD, and one of the first published 25 colour flow cytometry assays (Ashhurst et al. 2017). We also developed the first assays to be used on Australia’s first mass cytometer (CyTOF) (Ashhurst et al. 2019), as well as Australia’s first Imaging Mass Cytometer (IMC, SpectreMAP Github). We have recently published a book (HM McGuire, TM Ashhurst (eds). 2019), featuring a collecting of up-to-date and cutting-edge protocols in mass cytometry, which is now a standard resource in the field. Most recently, we have implemented high-dimensional spectral cytometry platforms and panels, and performed comprehensive evaluations of both conventional and spectral cytometry (Niewold*, Ashhurst* et al. 2020).
