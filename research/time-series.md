title: Time-series clustering analysis for mapping dynamic immune responses
permalink: /research/time-series/
---

The immune response to inflammation and disease is dynamic over time, and many studies collect samples over a time course of disease. However, the temporal aspects of these datasets are rarely use directly in the analysis of immune dynamics. While pseudo-time analysis approaches are common to infer trajectories in single-cell or cytometry data, actual-time analysis is an under-developed area. To address this limitaiton, we developed a number of approaches for clustering and analysing time-series data. Initially we developed ChronoClust (Putri)...

We subsequently build upon the FlowSOM algorithm to create TrackSOM...
