title: Application in inflammation and infectious disease
permalink: /research/disease/
---

Collectively, our central interest is in the comprehensive mapping of the immune response to inflammation and infectious disease at the single-cell level. We seek to apply multiple high-dimensional cytometry, single-cell, analysis approaches to facilitate a 'systems immunology' approach to our investigation. A particular focus of our group has been the study of immunopathology, where the immune response to infection may be a significant driver of disease.

        <p><b>SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 research</b></p>
        <p>
          The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has caused >101 million infections and 2.18 million deaths worldwide (as of January 28, 2021). Infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in a spectrum of clinical presentations, called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), ranging from asymptomatic to fatal disease. Our team began investigating the immune response to COVID-19 in March 2020, in collaboration with researchers at the <a href="https://www.doherty.edu.au/">Doherty Institute</a> and the <a href="https://www.unimelb.edu.au/">University of Melbourne</a>.

        <p><b>Mapping the immune dynamics of COVID-19</b></p>
        <p>
          Our team played a key role in one of Australia's large COVID-19 studies, led by the Kedzierska laboratory at the Doherty Institute (<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(21)00019-7">Koutsakos et al.</a> Pre-print: Oct 2020, published in <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(21)00019-7">Cell Reports Medicine</a>: Feb 2021). We developed and applyied <a href="https://immunedynamics.io/spectre/">high-dimensional analysis tools</a> to help comprehensively map the immune response to COVID-19, including a novel time-series analysis approach called <a href="https://immunedynamics.io/research/time-series/#tracksom">TrackSOM</a>. This study demonstrated that patients with severe disease exhibited an excessive and hyper-activated immune response, and was the first to show that T follicular helper cell responses could predict subsequent antibody levels, including neutralising activity of the antibody, a critical feature important for virus clearance and protection from infection.

## Viral encephalitis

![Viral](https://github.com/tomashhurst/tomashhurst.github.io/blob/master/images/Clusters.png?raw=true)

In mouse models of viral encephalitis, inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages which infiltrate into the brain contribute significantly to disease ([Getts et al. 2012](https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-2094-9-246)), where immune-modulatory therapies targeting inflammatory monocytes may inhibit this process ([Getts et al. 2014](https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/6/219/219ra7.short)). Our recent work has comprehensively profiled the immune infiltrate in models of viral encephalitis, revealing complex cellular kinetics in both Zika virus (ZIKV) ([Hayashida et al. 2019](https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12974-019-1566-5)) and West Nile virus (WNV) ([Ashhurst et al. 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.22.349563v1.abstract)) encephalitis. Additionally, we have demonstrated that viral encephalitis drives an *inflammatory mobilisation of the haematopoietic system* in the bone marrow, resulting in the generation of pathogenic monocytes ([Ashhurst et al 2019](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-9454-0_12), [Ashhurst 2020, Fluidigm webinar](https://www.fluidigm.com/articles/presentation---mapping-dynamic-immunity-across-time-space-and-disease-state-using-high%E2%80%90dimensional-cytometry-technologies-and-analytics)).

Through various collaborations, we have applied our approaches in a number of areas, including T cell exhaustion in LCMV infection ([Huber et al. 2017](https://jvi.asm.org/content/91/22/e01219-17.short)), VZV infection of NK cells ([Campbell et al. 2018](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?rev=1&id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006999)), antibody-mediated cell subset depletion ([Jung et al. 2018](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/201/7/2176.abstract)), interferon-mediated lethality in LCMV infection ([Jung et al. 2020](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1008525&rev=1)), B cell responses in multiple sclerosis ([Marsh-Wakefield et al. 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cti2.1133)), and intrapulmonary vaccination strategies ([Ferrell et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41385-021-00379-6)).
