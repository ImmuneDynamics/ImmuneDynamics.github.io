Most recently, we have adapted the Spectre package to facilitate [spatial analysis of IMC data](https://immunedynamics.io/research/spatial/). Our ongoing work is focused on the development of better data integration approaches and spatial analysis tools. See our [spatial analysis](https://immunedynamics.io/research/spatial/) page for more information.
