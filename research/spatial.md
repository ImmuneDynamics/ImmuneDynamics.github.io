Most recently, we have adapted the Spectre package to facilitate spatial analysis of IMC data ([SpectreMAP Github](https://github.com/ImmuneDynamics/SpectreMAP)). Our ongoing work is focused on the development of better data integration approaches and spatial analysis tools.

- Spatial analysis platform --> integrated with Spectre
- Improved cell segmentation workflows
- Spatial statistics and neighbourhood analysis
â€” examples in TBC
