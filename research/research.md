**Background**: 

Emerging viral diseases are a major threat to global health, affecting millions of people worldwide. This threat has been demonstrated in the emergence of novel coronaviruses, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus, which cause a respiratory disease with high mortality. Recently, the most wide-scale pandemic in modern times was caused by the novel SARS-like Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with infection leading to a severe form of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Similarly, severe and rapidly spreading disease has been seen in infection with flaviviruses, including Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile Virus (WNV), Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV), and dengue virus (DENV). In this setting, the immune response is a crucial component of host defence in preventing viral dissemination and invasion of host tissues. However, a key feature of many of these severe viral diseases is immunopathology, where an excessive immune response to the virus, mediated significantly by myeloid cells, causes substantial damage to critical host tissues, such as the lung (SARS, MERS, SARS-CoV-2) or central nervous system (ZIKV, WNV, JEV).

In order to rapidly response to, and understand, these complex immunologically-driven disease processes, the application of high-dimensional (HD) single-cell technologies is critical, allowing for the rapid profiling of immune responses in patients. The recent expansion of high-dimensional cytometry, single-cell, and imaging technologies has lead to a significant shift in our approach to analysing immunological data. As the size and complexity of high-dimensional cytometry data continue to expand, comprehensive, scalable, and methodical computational analysis approaches are essential. Yet, contemporary clustering and dimensionality reduction tools alone are insufficient to analyze or reproduce analyses across large numbers of samples, batches, or experiments. Moreover, approaches that allow for the integration of data across batches or experiments are not well incorporated into computational toolkits to allow for streamlined workflows, nor are approaches to analyse time-series data. Finally, single-cell atlas datasets, such as those being generated by the Human Cell Atlas and HubMAP consortiums, would allow for the rapid and automated classification of cell types, and the mapping of these cell types to relevant inflammatory states, greatly enhancing the speed and accuracy of investigations into novel diseases.

**Our work**: 

Initiated through a seed grant from the [Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity](https://www.sydney.edu.au/marie-bashir-institute/), we established the the [Immune Dynamics team](https://immunedynamics.io/team), a multi-disciplinary collaboration between [multiple research and technology labs](https://immunedynamics.io/team) at the University of Sydney; integrating expertise in immunology, infectious disease, single-cell & imaging technologies, computational biology, and data science. Our team seeks to comprehensively map dynamic immune repsonses at the single cell level, over time, in various inflammatory and infectious diseases. Through the development of novel [single-cell and imaging methods](), as well as [advanced computational analysis approaches](), we seek to address key challenges in the study of inflammation, and develop single-cell 'atlases' that may be leveraged to reveal key mediators of health and disease, as part of larger efforts such as the [Human Cell Atlas]() project. Our team has a particular interest in the study of emerging infectious diseases, such as [COVID-19](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease) (SARS-CoV-2), [Zika virus](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease) encephalitis, and [West Nile virus](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease) encephalitis. 

Below we detail our specific areas of research and development. More information on the research interests of our individual members can be found on the [team](https://immunedynamics.io/team/) page.

# Data analysis and integration across cytometry and single-cell technologies

A major focus of our collaborative group is the development of computational analysis solutions for high-dimensional cytometry data.

Key to our 'systems immunology' approach to studing inflammation and infectious disease is the capacity to analyse and integrate datasets generated by different single-cell and cytometry technologies. In particular, the challenges in analysing high-dimensional flow, spectral, or mass cytometry (CyTOF) datasets are different to those typically faced in analysing single-cell sequencing data, This is largely due to the large number of cells in cytometry datasets, consisting of tens to hundreds of millions of cells. However, fewer features can be measured on individual cells through these cytometry technologies (typically <50 proteins), when compared to single-cell multiomic approaches (such as CITE-seq: thousands of transcripts and 228 proteins), though fewer cells are measured. Ideally, we could utilise a system that is versatile enough to manage data generated through different cytometry or single-cell technologies, with a built in capacity to integrate datasets across batches, experiments, or technologies.

To address these challenges, we developed '[Spectre](https://immunedynamics.io/spectre/)', a computational toolkit in R that enables comprehensive end-to-end integration, exploration, and analysis of high-dimensional cytometry data from different batches or experiments ([Ashhurst et al, 2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.22.349563v1.abstract)). Spectre streamlines the analytical stages of raw data pre-processing, batch alignment, data integration, clustering, dimensionality reduction, visualisation and population labelling, as well as quantitative and statistical analysis; with a simple, clear, and modular design of analysis workflows, that can be utilised by data and laboratory scientists. 

Inspired by the efforts of the [Human Cell Atlas (HCA)](http://humancellatlas.org/), we sought to create an interface that would allow a seamless transition across a wide variety of single-cell data types - including flow, spectral, CyTOF, and scRNAseq, including multiomic assays such as CITE-seq and Abseq. In particular, our goal was to faciliate integration and label transfer between datasets, so that reference datasets generated by the HCA and other groups could be leveraged in a wide variety of contexts, in both HD cytometry and single-cell sequencing. By creating a technology and data-agnostic platform, we can efficiently incorporate various analysis tools, and particular integration tools, developed for cytometry (e.g. FlowSOM, CytoNorm) and transcriptomics (e.g. Harmony, Liger, Seurat). By doing this, multiple approaches can be efficiently run and compared within a single environment. Critically, as many existing scRNAseq tools [do not scale well to large datasets](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1850-9#Abs1), we have focused our analysis and integration approaches around methods that can scale to large datasets consisting of millions of cells.

# Time-series clustering analysis for mapping dynamic immune responses

The immune response to inflammation and disease is dynamic over time, and many studies collect samples over a time course of disease. However, the temporal aspects of these datasets are rarely use directly in the analysis of immune dynamics. While pseudo-time analysis approaches are common to infer trajectories in single-cell or cytometry data, actual-time analysis is an under-developed area. To address this limitaiton, we developed a number of approaches for clustering and analysing time-series data. Initially we developed ChronoClust (Putri)...

We subsequently build upon the FlowSOM algorithm to create TrackSOM...

# Single-cell systems immunology of inflammation and infectious disease

Collectively, our central interest is in the comprehensive mapping of the immune response to inflammation and infectious disease at the single-cell level. We seek to apply multiple high-dimensional cytometry, single-cell, analysis approaches to facilitate a 'systems immunology' approach to our investigation. A particular focus of our group has been the study of immunopathology, where the immune response to infection may be a significant driver of disease.

### COVID-19

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has caused >101 million infections and 2.18 million deaths worldwide (as of January 28, 2021). Infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in a spectrum of clinical presentations, called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), ranging from asymptomatic to fatal disease. Through a collaboration with the [Doherty Institute](https://www.doherty.edu.au/) and the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/), we comprehensively profiled the immune response to [SARS-CoV-2](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) in a cohort of [COVID-19](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) patients. Our work demonstrated that patients with severe disease exhibited an excessive and hyper-activated immune response ([Koutsakos et al. 2021](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(21)00019-7)). To study the kinetics of this immune response, we also developed and applied a novel time-series analysis approach called [TrackSOM](https://github.com/ghar1821/TrackSOM).

### Viral encephalitis

In mouse models of viral encephalitis, our work has demonstrated that inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages which infiltrate into the brain contribute significantly to disease in [Zika virus](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/zika-virus) encephalitis ([Hayashida et al. 2019](https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12974-019-1566-5)) and [West Nile virus](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/west-nile-virus) encephalitis ([Getts et al. 2012](https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-2094-9-246)), and that *immune-modulatory therapies* targeting inflammatory monocytes may inhibit this process ([Getts et al. 2014](https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/6/219/219ra7.short)). This work was featured on [ABC News](http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2014/01/16/3926376.htm) and [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/16/heart-attack-damage-can-be-reduced-with-a-simple-injection-say-experts). Our most recent work has demonstrated that viral encephalitis drives an *inflammatory mobilisation of the haematopoietic system* in the bone marrow, resulting in the generation of these pathogenic monocytes ([Ashhurst et al 2019](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-9454-0_12), [Ashhurst 2020, Fluidigm webinar](https://www.fluidigm.com/articles/presentation---mapping-dynamic-immunity-across-time-space-and-disease-state-using-high%E2%80%90dimensional-cytometry-technologies-and-analytics)).
