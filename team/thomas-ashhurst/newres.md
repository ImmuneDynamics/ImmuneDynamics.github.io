**Inflammatory response of the bone marrow during viral encephalitis**
- BM mobilsation in viral encephalitis, starting with flow

**Stanford University and Australia's first CyTOF**
- CyTOF (Stanford)
- CAPX

## Sydney Cytometry Facility (2017 - present): high-dimensional cytometry, spatial, and single-cell technologies

- HD flow with LSR-X -- this with analysis strategies applied to range of projects (e.g. Hofer); and WNV/ZIKV
- Starting up IMC with the facility + analysis
- Spectral cytometry
- Now scRNAseq

- CYTO Asia State of the Art talk
- Numerous talks since

- CURRENTLY: HD spectral, IMC, analysis, scRNAseq, multiomics

## Immune Dynamics initiative (2017 - present): development of novel single-cell and computational methods for single-cell systems immunology

- Started collaborative initiative between SC, path, and CS
- Initially with solving HD analysis and 'time-series' analysis problems
- MBI funding
- Spectre
- Timeseries: ChronoClust, TrackSOM
- Spatial analysis: SpectreMAP
- Human Cell atlas: Meetings in 2018, 2019 -- HD cytometry and our approaches benefit from, and/or contribute to HCA

- Applied to COVID-19 and ZIKV, among others...

- Featured in OSC etc

- CURRENTLY: data integration an application to comprehensively map...
