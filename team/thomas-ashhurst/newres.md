## King lab (2012 - 2016): Mobilisation of....

- BM mobilsation in viral encephalitis, starting with flow
- CyTOF (Stanford)
- CAPX
- Large flow panels
- Bone marrow mobilisation

## Sydney Cytometry Facility (2017 - present): advanced training and consultation for users of HD cytometry, spatial, and single-cell technologies

- HD flow with LSR-X -- this with analysis strategies applied to range of projects (e.g. Hofer); and WNV/ZIKV
- Starting up IMC with the facility + analysis
- Spectral cytometry
- Now scRNAseq

## Immune Dynamics initiative (2017 - present): development of novel single-cell and computational methods for single-cell systems immunology

- Started collaborative initiative between SC, path, and CS
- Initially with solving HD analysis and 'time-series' analysis problems
- MBI funding
- Spectre

- Timeseries: ChronoClust, TrackSOM
- Spatial analysis: SpectreMAP
- Human Cell atlas: Meetings in 2018, 2019 -- HD cytometry and our approaches benefit from, and/or contribute to HCA

- Applied to COVID-19 and ZIKV, among others...
