I am a current [ISAC Marylou Ingram Scholar](https://isac-net.org/page/Marylou-Ingram-Scholars) with the [International Society for the Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC)](https://isac-net.org/), and serve as the 'Systems Cytometry' & NSW representative of the [Systems Immunology special interest group (SIG)](https://www.immunology.org.au/asi-programs-and-opportunities/special-interest-groups/systems-immunology/) of the [Australian and New Zealand Society of Immunology](https://www.immunology.org.au/).

We are involved with a number of societies and communities, including the [International Society for the Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC)](https://isac-net.org/), the [Australasian Cytometry Society (ACS)](https://cytometry.org.au/), the [Australia and New Zealand Society for Immunology (ASI)](https://www.immunology.org.au/), the [Oz Single Cell (OSC)](https://www.singlecells.org.au/) community, and the [Fluidigm Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC)](https://www.fluidigm.com/articles/imc-user-group-meeting-2019-recap) users community. We have also engaged in a number of community-focused educational endeavours, such as the ACS roadshows in 2016 (**Polychromatic Flow Cytometry**; Dr. Pratip Chattopadhyay and [Thomas Ashhurst](tomashhurst.github.io)) and in 2020 (**[High-dimensional analysis](https://www.immunology.org.au/Programs/Special-Interest-Groups/Systems-Immunology/acs-asi-homeshow-2020/)**; [Dr. Thomas Ashhurst](tomashhurst.github.io), [Dr. Felix Marsh-Wakefield](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6PaVkisAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Givanna Putri](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S-sNLPIAAAAJ&hl=en)).

![HCA](https://github.com/tomashhurst/tomashhurst.github.io/blob/master/images/HCA%20wide.png?raw=true)

We are actively involved in the [Human Cell Atlas (HCA)](https://www.humancellatlas.org/) community, including attendance at HCA general meetings in **Hinxton, UK (2018)**, and [Tokyo, Japan (2019)](https://youtu.be/xYqd2w_aRH0?t=327), seeking to help define the contribution of high-dimensional cytometry and imaging technologies to the objectives of the HCA ([Czechowska et al. 2018, WS06: 'Cytometry in the Era of the Human Cell Atlas'](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cyto.a.23777)). We also presented on Spectre, one of our computational tools, at the [HCA Asia meeting](https://youtu.be/95dy_p5FFck?t=15491) (virtual) in 2020.

![Roadshows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomashhurst/tomashhurst.github.io/master/images/Homeshow%20wide%20thin.png)

We have taken a key role in two roadshows hosted by the [Australasian Cytometry Society (ACS)](https://cytometry.org.au/): [Polychromatic Flow Cytometry](https://www.malaghan.org.nz/news/world-class-roadshow-for-flow-cytometry-community/) in 2016 (Dr. Pratip Chattopadhyay and Thomas Ashhurst), and [High-Dimensional Cytometry Analysis](https://www.immunology.org.au/files/Newsletter_pdfs/ASI017_Dec_2020.pdf#page=35) in 2020 (Dr. Thomas Ashhurst, Dr. Felix Marsh-Wakefield, and Givanna Putri).
