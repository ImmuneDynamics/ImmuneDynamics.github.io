## Overview

My research involves the development and application of new [high-dimensional cytometry, single-cell, and imaging methods](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#high-dimensional-cytometry-and-imaging-technologies), as well as novel [computational and machine learning analysis approaches](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#computational-analysis-approaches), to comprehensively map dynamic immune responses at the single-cell level over time and across multiple biological tissues, to reveal key mediators of inflammation and immunity. To enable this, I co-lead a [multi-disciplinary collaboration](), drawing from [multiple research and technology labs]() at the University of Sydney, integrating expertise in immunology, infectious disease, high-dimensional single-cell & imaging technologies, computational biology, and data science. My team and I work to develop novel methods and analytical approaches, and apply these approaches collaboratively to profile inflammatory responses in a variety of disease settings. In particular, we apply these to the study of infectious disease, including emerging pathogens such as [SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease), [Zika virus](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease) encephalitis, and [West Nile virus](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease) encephalitis. We then explore how these datasets, technologies, and analysis methodologies may contribute to, or benefit from, efforts such as the [Human Cell Atlas (HCA)](http://humancellatlas.org/). We apply our high-dimensional technologies and analysis approaches to study inflammation and infectious disease. A particular focus has been the study of *immunopathology*, where the immune response to infection may be a significant driver of disease.

## SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 ##

![COVID](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomashhurst/tomashhurst.github.io/master/images/COVID%20image%20wide%202.png)

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has caused >101 million infections and 2.18 million deaths worldwide (as of January 28, 2021). Infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in a spectrum of clinical presentations, called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), ranging from asymptomatic to fatal disease. Through a collaboration with the [Doherty Institute](https://www.doherty.edu.au/) and the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/), we comprehensively profiled the immune response to [SARS-CoV-2](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) in a cohort of [COVID-19](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) patients. Our work demonstrated that patients with severe disease exhibited an excessive and hyper-activated immune response ([Koutsakos et al. 2021](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(21)00019-7)). To study the kinetics of this immune response, we also developed and applied a novel time-series analysis approach called [TrackSOM](https://github.com/ghar1821/TrackSOM).

## Zika and West Nile virus encephalitis ##

Previously with the [King Lab](https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/nicholas-king.html) during my PhD, and currently with the [Sydney Cytometry Facility](https://sydneycytometry.org.au/), a significant research interest has been focused on viral encephalitis. In mouse models of viral encephalitis, our work has demonstrated that inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages which infiltrate into the brain contribute significantly to disease in [Zika virus](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/zika-virus) encephalitis ([Hayashida et al. 2019](https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12974-019-1566-5)) and [West Nile virus](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/west-nile-virus) encephalitis ([Getts et al. 2012](https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-2094-9-246)), and that *immune-modulatory therapies* targeting inflammatory monocytes may inhibit this process ([Getts et al. 2014](https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/6/219/219ra7.short)). This work was featured on [ABC News](http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2014/01/16/3926376.htm) and [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/16/heart-attack-damage-can-be-reduced-with-a-simple-injection-say-experts). Our most recent work has demonstrated that viral encephalitis drives an *inflammatory mobilisation of the haematopoietic system* in the bone marrow, resulting in the generation of these pathogenic monocytes ([Ashhurst et al 2019](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-9454-0_12), [Ashhurst 2020, Fluidigm webinar](https://www.fluidigm.com/articles/presentation---mapping-dynamic-immunity-across-time-space-and-disease-state-using-high%E2%80%90dimensional-cytometry-technologies-and-analytics)).

## General immunology ##

Through various collaborations, we have applied our approaches in a number of areas, such as IRF8 depletion ([Terry et al. 2015](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/365972)), T cell exhaustion in LCMV infection ([Huber et al. 2017](https://jvi.asm.org/content/91/22/e01219-17.short)), VZV infection of NK cells ([Campbell et al. 2018](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?rev=1&id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006999)), antibody-mediated cell subset depletion ([Jung et al. 2018](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/201/7/2176.abstract)), interferon-mediated lethality in LCMV infection ([Jung et al. 2020](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1008525&rev=1)), B cell responses in multiple sclerosis ([Marsh-Wakefield et al. 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cti2.1133)), and intrapulmonary vaccination strategies ([Ferrell et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41385-021-00379-6)).

## Engagement in the Human Cell Atlas and other communities ##

![HCA](https://github.com/tomashhurst/tomashhurst.github.io/blob/master/images/HCA%20wide.png?raw=true)

We are actively involved in the [Human Cell Atlas (HCA)](https://www.humancellatlas.org/) community, including attendance at HCA general meetings in Hinxton, UK (2018), and [Tokyo, Japan (2019)](https://youtu.be/xYqd2w_aRH0?t=327), seeking to help define the contribution of high-dimensional cytometry and imaging technologies to the HCA objectives ([Czechowska et al. 2018, WS06: 'Cytometry in the Era of the Human Cell Atlas'](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cyto.a.23777)). We also presented on Spectre, one of our computational tools, at the [HCA Asia meeting](https://youtu.be/95dy_p5FFck?t=15491) (virtual) in 2020.
