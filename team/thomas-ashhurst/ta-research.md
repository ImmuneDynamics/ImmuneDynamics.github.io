**Overview**: the overall goal of my research is to comprehensively map dynamic immune responses at the single-cell level, over time and across multiple biological tissues, to reveal key mediators of inflammation and immunity in health and disease. To faciliate this goal, I lead a [multi-disciplinary collaboration](), drawing from [multiple research and technology labs]() at the University of Sydney, combining expertise in immunology, infectious disease, high-dimensional single-cell & imaging technologies, computational biology, and data science. Together, my team and I develop and apply new [high-dimensional cytometry, single-cell, and imaging methods](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#high-dimensional-cytometry-and-imaging-technologies), as well as novel [computational and machine learning analysis approaches](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#computational-analysis-approaches), to enable us to deeply characterise the immune response to disease, in both single-cell and spatial data. In particular, we collaboratively apply our approaches to profile the inflammatory responses to infectious disease, including emerging pathogens such as [SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease), [Zika virus](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease) encephalitis, and [West Nile virus](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease) encephalitis. We then explore how these datasets, technologies, and analysis methodologies may contribute to, or benefit from, efforts such as the [Human Cell Atlas (HCA)](http://humancellatlas.org/).

## High-dimensional cytometry, imaging, and single-cell technologies ##

Critical to investigating the complex immune response to disease is the capacity to measure cells at the single-cell level, examining multiple features of the cell simultaneously. However, the development and implimentation of new methods that can achieve this is inherently challenging. To address this, I have lead a number of developments of new cytometry technologies or assays. 

In 2014, during my PhD in the laboratory of [Prof. Nicholas King](https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/nicholas-king.html), I was the first to develop and apply assays using Australia's first mass cytometer (CyTOF), having recieved training in mass cytometry in the laboratory of [Dr. Garry Nolan]() at [Stanford University](). I used this novel technology to comprehensively profile inflammatory mobilisation of the murine haematopoietic system in the bone marrow during viral encephalitis. In 2016, with the [Sydney Cytometry Core Research Facility](), I took a leading role in the development of a novel cytometry platform, our world first [10-laser 30-parameter ‘LSR-X’](https://sydneycytometry.org.au/hdflow) platform, developed in collaboration with BD. This was the first high-parameter cytometry to be implimented in Australia, and the 25-colour panel we developed for it was the first published panel that reached above 18 colours ([Ashhurst, Smith, King. 2017](https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpim.37)).

Roadshow


We also developed the first assays to be used on [Australia’s first mass cytometer (CyTOF)](https://www.immunology.org.au/files/Newsletter_pdfs/ASI_NL_March_2015.pdf) ([Ashhurst et al. 2019](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-9454-0_12)), as well as Australia’s first Imaging Mass Cytometer (IMC, [SpectreMAP Github](https://github.com/ImmuneDynamics/SpectreMAP)). We have recently published a book ([HM McGuire, TM Ashhurst (eds). 2019](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4939-9454-0)), featuring a collecting of up-to-date and cutting-edge protocols in mass cytometry, which is now a standard resource in the field. Most recently, we have implemented high-dimensional spectral cytometry platforms and panels, and performed comprehensive evaluations of both conventional and spectral cytometry ([Niewold\*, Ashhurst\* et al. 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cyto.a.24211)).

![Research](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomashhurst/tomashhurst.github.io/master/images/Research.png)

Following a seed funding grant from the [Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity](https://www.sydney.edu.au/marie-bashir-institute/) (*"Mapping dynamic immunity: next-generation computational approaches to track the evolution of immune responses in West Nile virus and Zika virus encephalitis"*), we established the ‘[Immune Dynamics](https://github.com/ImmuneDynamics)’ team, a collaborative group with a focus on the development of novel computational analysis tools to address challenges in high-dimensional analysis.

My team and I have developed a number of computational analysis approaches, including [SPECTRE](https://wiki.centenary.org.au/display/SPECTRE), an R package that enables comprehensive end-to-end integration and analysis of high-dimensional cytometry data from different batches or experiments ([Ashhurst\*,  Marsh-Wakefield\*, Putri\* et al. bioRxiv. 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.22.349563v1.abstract)). To facilitate the analysis of time-series data, we have also developed a number of time-series clustering algorithms, including [ChronoClust](https://github.com/ghar1821/Chronoclust) ([Putri et al. 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705119300796)) and [TrackSOM](https://github.com/ghar1821/TrackSOM), which we recently applied to the study of [COVID-19](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease) ([Koutsakos et al. 2021](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(21)00019-7)). We have also developed novel multi-perspective methods for the evaluation of clustering algorithms ([Putri et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab038)). Most recently, we have adapted the Spectre package to facilitate spatial analysis of IMC data ([SpectreMAP Github](https://github.com/ImmuneDynamics/SpectreMAP)). Our ongoing work is focused on the development of better data integration approaches and spatial analysis tools.

## Application to disease ##

![COVID](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomashhurst/tomashhurst.github.io/master/images/COVID%20image%20wide%202.png)

We apply our high-dimensional technologies and analysis approaches to study inflammation and infectious disease. A particular focus has been the study of *immunopathology*, where the immune response to infection may be a significant driver of disease. 

**SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19**

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has caused >101 million infections and 2.18 million deaths worldwide (as of January 28, 2021). Infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in a spectrum of clinical presentations, called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), ranging from asymptomatic to fatal disease. Through a collaboration with the [Doherty Institute](https://www.doherty.edu.au/) and the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/), we comprehensively profiled the immune response to [SARS-CoV-2](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) in a cohort of [COVID-19](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) patients. Our work demonstrated that patients with severe disease exhibited an excessive and hyper-activated immune response ([Koutsakos et al. 2021](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(21)00019-7)). To study the kinetics of this immune response, we also developed and applied a novel time-series analysis approach called [TrackSOM](https://github.com/ghar1821/TrackSOM).

**Zika and West Nile virus encephalitis and immune modulation**

Previously with the [King Lab](https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/nicholas-king.html) during my PhD, and currently with the [Sydney Cytometry Facility](https://sydneycytometry.org.au/), 

In mouse models of viral encephalitis, our work has demonstrated that inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages which infiltrate into the brain contribute significantly to disease in [Zika virus](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/zika-virus) encephalitis ([Hayashida et al. 2019](https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12974-019-1566-5)) and [West Nile virus](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/west-nile-virus) encephalitis ([Getts et al. 2012](https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-2094-9-246)), and that *immune-modulatory therapies* targeting inflammatory monocytes may inhibit this process ([Getts et al. 2014](https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/6/219/219ra7.short)). This work was featured on [ABC News](http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2014/01/16/3926376.htm) and [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/16/heart-attack-damage-can-be-reduced-with-a-simple-injection-say-experts). Our most recent work has demonstrated that viral encephalitis drives an *inflammatory mobilisation of the haematopoietic system* in the bone marrow, resulting in the generation of these pathogenic monocytes ([Ashhurst et al 2019](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-9454-0_12), [Ashhurst 2020, Fluidigm webinar](https://www.fluidigm.com/articles/presentation---mapping-dynamic-immunity-across-time-space-and-disease-state-using-high%E2%80%90dimensional-cytometry-technologies-and-analytics)).

**Immunology**

Through various collaborations, we have applied our approaches in a number of areas, such as IRF8 depletion ([Terry et al. 2015](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/365972)), T cell exhaustion in LCMV infection ([Huber et al. 2017](https://jvi.asm.org/content/91/22/e01219-17.short)), VZV infection of NK cells ([Campbell et al. 2018](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?rev=1&id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006999)), antibody-mediated cell subset depletion ([Jung et al. 2018](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/201/7/2176.abstract)), interferon-mediated lethality in LCMV infection ([Jung et al. 2020](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1008525&rev=1)), B cell responses in multiple sclerosis ([Marsh-Wakefield et al. 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cti2.1133)), and intrapulmonary vaccination strategies ([Ferrell et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41385-021-00379-6)).
