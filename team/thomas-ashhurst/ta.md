Dr. Thomas Ashhurst is a research immunologist specialising in the study of inflammation and infectious disease. He is a High-Dimensional Cytometry and Single-Cell Specialist with the [Sydney Cytometry Core Research Facility](https://sydneycytometry.org.au), and an Honorary Research Fellow with the [Infection, Immunity, and Inflammation](https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/schools/sydney-medical-school/discipline-of-infectious-diseases-and-immunology.html) Theme, [School of Medical Sciences](https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/schools/school-of-medical-sciences.html), at the [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). 
In these roles he provides advanced training and consultation for users of high-dimensional cytometry, imaging, and single-cell sequencing technologies.
He also leads a [multi-disciplinary research initiative](https://immunedynamics.github.io) to develop a range of [high-dimensional single-cell and imaging methods](https://immunedynamics.github.io/thomas-ashhurst/research/#high-dimensional-cytometry-and-imaging-technologies), as well as [advanced computational analysis approaches](https://immunedynamics.github.io/thomas-ashhurst/research/#computational-analysis-approaches), and apply them to comprehensively map dynamic immune responses over time and space using a 'systems immunology' approach. His research is particularly focused on the study of inflammation and infectious diseases, including emerging pathogens such as [SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19](https://immunedynamics.github.io/thomas-ashhurst/research/#application-to-disease), [Zika virus encephalitis](https://immunedynamics.github.io/thomas-ashhurst/research/#application-to-disease), and [West Nile virus encephalitis](https://immunedynamics.github.io/thomas-ashhurst/research/#application-to-disease).

Dr. Ashhurst's training includes a Bachelor of Science (hons) and a Ph.D. in Medicine (Pathology and Immunology) from the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/), where he investigated the mobilisation of the murine haematopoietic and immune systems in response to viral encephalitis using [high-dimensional flow and mass cytometry](https://immunedynamics.github.io/thomas-ashhurst/research/#high-dimensional-cytometry-and-imaging-technologies) in the laboratory of [Prof. Nicholas King](https://immunedynamics.github.io/team). He was a recipient of a [Sydney Medical School](https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/schools/sydney-medical-school.html) travelling fellowship in 2014 to facilitate his training in [mass cytometry](https://immunedynamics.github.io/thomas-ashhurst/research/#high-dimensional-cytometry-and-imaging-technologies) in the laboratory of [Dr. Garry Nolan](http://web.stanford.edu/group/nolan/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) as a visiting researcher.

Dr. Ashhurst was awarded a prestigious [ISAC Marylou Ingram Scholarship](https://immunedynamics.github.io/thomas-ashhurst/community/) by the [International Society for the Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC)](https://immunedynamics.github.io/thomas-ashhurst/community/) in 2017, and currently serves as the 'Systems Cytometry' & NSW representative of the [Systems Immunology special interest group (SIG)](https://immunedynamics.github.io/thomas-ashhurst/community/) of the [Australian and New Zealand Society of Immunology](https://immunedynamics.github.io/thomas-ashhurst/community/). 
<!-- ... and leads the 'Single-Cell Systems Immunology' node of the Marie Bashir Institue for Emerging Infecitous Disease and Biosecurity (MBI). --> 
He is also actively involved in the [Australasian Cytometry Society](https://immunedynamics.github.io/thomas-ashhurst/community/), [Oz Single Cell consortium](https://immunedynamics.github.io/thomas-ashhurst/community/), and [Human Cell Atlas (HCA)](https://immunedynamics.github.io/thomas-ashhurst/community/) community.
