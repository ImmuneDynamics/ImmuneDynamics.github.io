Dr. Thomas Ashhurst is an immunologist and high-dimensional cytometry specialist with the [Sydney Cytometry Core Research Facility](https://sydneycytometry.org.au) at [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/), where he provides advanced training and consultation for users of high-dimensional cytometry, imaging, and single-cell sequencing technologies. In this role, he also co-leads an [multi-disciplinary team]() with a research focus on the development and application of a range of [high-dimensional cytometry, single-cell, and imaging methods](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#high-dimensional-cytometry-and-imaging-technologies), as well as [advanced computational analysis approaches](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#computational-analysis-approaches), to collaboratively map dynamic immune responses over time and space in range of disease contexts, including emerging pathogens such as [SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease), [Zika virus encephalitis](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease), and [West Nile virus encephalitis](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#application-to-disease).

Dr. Ashhurst's training includes a Bachelor of Science (hons) and a Ph.D. in Medicine (Pathology/Immunology) from the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/), where he investigated the mobilisation of the murine haematopoietic and immune systems in response to viral encephalitis using [high-dimensional flow and mass cytometry](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#high-dimensional-cytometry-and-imaging-technologies) in the laboratory of [Prof. Nicholas King](https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/nicholas-king.html). He was a recipient of a [Sydney Medical School](https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/schools/sydney-medical-school.html) travelling fellowship in 2014 to facilitate his training in [mass cytometry](https://tomashhurst.github.io/research/#high-dimensional-cytometry-and-imaging-technologies) in the laboratory of [Dr. Garry Nolan](http://web.stanford.edu/group/nolan/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) as a visiting researcher.

Dr. Ashhurst was awarded a prestigious [ISAC Marylou Ingram Scholarship](https://isac-net.org/page/Marylou-Ingram-Scholars) by the [International Society for the Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC)](https://isac-net.org/) in 2017, and currently serves as the 'Systems Cytometry' & NSW representative of the [Systems Immunology special interest group (SIG)](https://www.immunology.org.au/asi-programs-and-opportunities/special-interest-groups/systems-immunology/) of the [Australian and New Zealand Society of Immunology](https://www.immunology.org.au/). He is also actively involved in the [Australasian Cytometry Society](https://cytometry.org.au/), [Oz Single Cell consortium](https://www.singlecells.org.au/), and [Human Cell Atlas (HCA)](https://www.humancellatlas.org/) community, attending HCA general meetings in [Hinxton, UK (2018)](https://tomashhurst.github.io/community/), and [Tokyo, Japan (2019)](https://youtu.be/xYqd2w_aRH0?t=327).
