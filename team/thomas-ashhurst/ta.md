Dr. Thomas Ashhurst is an immunologist and high-dimensional cytometry/single-cell specialist with the [Sydney Cytometry Core Research Facility](https://sydneycytometry.org.au), and an Honorary Research Fellow with the [Infection, Immunity, and Inflammation](https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/schools/sydney-medical-school/discipline-of-infectious-diseases-and-immunology.html) Theme, [School of Medical Sciences](https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/schools/school-of-medical-sciences.html), at [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). In these roles he leads the development and application of a number of high-dimensional cytometry, imaging, and single-cell sequencing technologies, providing advanced training and consultation for researchers. 
He also leads a [multi-disciplinary ‘systems immunology’ initiative](https://immunedynamics.github.io), seeking to comprehensively map the immune response to inflammation and emerging infectious diseases, including [viral encephalitis](https://immunedynamics.io/research/disease/) and [COVID-19](https://immunedynamics.io/research/disease/#sars-cov-2-and-covid-19), using high-dimensional [single-cell and imaging methods](https://immunedynamics.io/research/technology/) in addition to [advanced computational analysis](https://immunedynamics.io/spectre/) approaches.

Dr. Ashhurst's training includes a Bachelor of Science (hons) and a Ph.D. in Medicine (Pathology and Immunology) from the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/), where he investigated the mobilisation of the murine haematopoietic and immune systems in response to viral encephalitis using [high-dimensional flow and mass cytometry](https://immunedynamics.github.io/thomas-ashhurst/research/#high-dimensional-cytometry-and-imaging-technologies) in the laboratory of [Prof. Nicholas King](https://immunedynamics.github.io/team). He was a recipient of a [Sydney Medical School](https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/schools/sydney-medical-school.html) travelling fellowship in 2014 to facilitate his training in [mass cytometry](https://immunedynamics.github.io/thomas-ashhurst/research/#high-dimensional-cytometry-and-imaging-technologies) in the laboratory of [Dr. Garry Nolan](http://web.stanford.edu/group/nolan/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) as a visiting researcher.

Dr. Ashhurst co-leads the [Single Cell Biology](https://www.sydney.edu.au/charles-perkins-centre/our-research/current-research/integrative-systems-and-modelling/single-cell-biology.html) node of the Charles Perkins Centre, serves as the 'Systems Cytometry' & NSW representative of the [Systems Immunology special interest group (SIG)](https://www.immunology.org.au/asi-programs-and-opportunities/special-interest-groups/systems-immunology/) of the [Australian and New Zealand Society of Immunology](https://www.immunology.org.au/), and was awarded a prestigious [ISAC Marylou Ingram Scholarship](https://immunedynamics.github.io/thomas-ashhurst/community/) by the [International Society for the Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC)](https://immunedynamics.github.io/thomas-ashhurst/community/) in 2017. He is a collaborating member of the [Human Cell Atlas (HCA)](https://www.humancellatlas.org/) project, and is actively involved in the [Australasian Cytometry Society](https://cytometry.org.au/) and [Oz Single Cell consortium](https://www.singlecells.org.au/).
