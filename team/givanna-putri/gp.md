Givanna Putri is a post-doctoral researcher at the Bioinformatics division of The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. 
She is a computer scientist with keen interest in developing computational tools and workflows to advance the analysis of single-cell, cytometry, and spatial data. 
She has no preference over any programming languages but predominantly uses R and Python. She doesn't like those who are overly passionate over a given programming language or framework, and thinks they are all just means to tell computers to crunch data for her and those who are not familiar with programming.

Givanna was awarded her PhD in Computer Science in 2021 at the University of Sydney, during which she developed computational methods to explicitly cluster and track cellular populations development in time-course high dimensional cytometry data.
This included the TrackSOM algorithm which was recently used to profile [SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19](https://immunedynamics.io/research/disease) patients, and the [ChronoClust](https://github.com/ghar1821/Chronoclust) algorithm which publication on the Knowledge Based System journal won the Dolby scientific paper competition in 2019.
In 2019, she was awarded The Student Travel Award from the International Society for Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC) and The Postgraduate Research Support Scheme from The University of Sydney to present ChronoClust at the 34th Congress of the International Society for Advancement of Cytometry (CYTO) conference.
She also developed a novel benchmarking methodology [ParetoBench](https://github.com/ghar1821/ParetoBench) which uses the Pareto Front framework to fairly compare the performances of clustering algorithms using several performance metrics.
Her PhD research was funded by The Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship and The University of Sydney Alumni Scholarship.
