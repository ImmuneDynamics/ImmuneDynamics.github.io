My research involves developing and applying high-dimensional cytometry and imaging technologies, as well as computational analysis tools, to map dynamic immune responses over time, space, and disease. I apply these approaches to the study of immunology and infectious disease, including emerging pathogens such as [SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(21)00019-7), [Zika virus encephalitis](https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12974-019-1566-5), and [West Nile virus encephalitis](https://jneuroinflammation.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-2094-9-246). An overview of this work can be found in these key presentations:

### High-dimensional cytometry and imaging technologies ###

A key focus of ours is the development and implimentation of high-dimensional cytometry technologies and assays, including high-dimensional [flow cytometry](https://sydneycytometry.org.au/flowcytometry), [spectral cytometry](https://sydneycytometry.org.au/flowcytometry), [mass cytometry/CyTOF](https://sydneycytometry.org.au/masscytometry/cytof), and [Imaging Mass Cytometry](https://sydneycytometry.org.au/masscytometry/imc) (IMC).

In order to sufficiently analyse the high-dimensional datasets, we have developed a number of computational analysis approaches, including the [Spectre](https://github.com/ImmuneDynamics/Spectre) analysis platform in R, time-series clustering using the [ChronoClust](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705119300796) algorithm, and [single cell segmentation and spatial analysis of IMC data](https://wiki.centenary.org.au/x/nP5DCg).
