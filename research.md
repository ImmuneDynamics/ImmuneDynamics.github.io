- Not a lab -- so our collective interest cover a range of areas in immunology, infectious disease, single-cell and cytometry technologies, computational biology, and data science.

Key areas:

Development
- Cytometry Technologies
- Computational and spatial analysis Tools

Application
- COVID-19
- Viral encephalitis
- Immunology

Following a seed funding grant from the [Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity](https://www.sydney.edu.au/marie-bashir-institute/), we established the ‘[Immune Dynamics team](https://immunedynamics.io/about)’, a collaboration combining expertise in immunology, high-dimensional single-cell technologies, computational biology, and data science; drawing from the [Sydney Cytometry Core Research Facility](https://sydneycytometry.org.au/), the [Discipline of Pathology](https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/schools/school-of-medical-sciences/discipline-of-pathology.html), and the [School of Computer Science](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-computer-science.html), at the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). Our team focuses on the development of novel computational analysis tools to address challenges in modern single-cell sciences, and the application of these tools in the study of immunology and infectious diseases, such as [COVID-19](https://immunedynamics.io/research).

We have developed a number of computational analysis approaches, including [Spectre](immunedynamics.io/spectre), an R package that enables comprehensive end-to-end integration and analysis of high-dimensional cytometry data from different batches or experiments ([Ashhurst\*,  Marsh-Wakefield\*, Putri\* et al. bioRxiv. 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.22.349563v1.abstract)). To facilitate the analysis of time-series data, we have also developed a number of time-series clustering algorithms, including [ChronoClust](https://github.com/ghar1821/Chronoclust) ([Putri et al. 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705119300796)) and [TrackSOM](https://github.com/ghar1821/TrackSOM), which we recently applied to the study of [COVID-19](https://immunedynamics.io/research) ([Koutsakos et al. 2021](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(21)00019-7)). Most recently, we have adapted the Spectre package to facilitate spatial analysis of IMC data ([SpectreMAP Github](https://github.com/ImmuneDynamics/SpectreMAP)). 

Our ongoing work is focused on the development of better data integration approaches and spatial analysis tools. You can read more about our work on the [research](https://immunedynamics.io/research) page.
